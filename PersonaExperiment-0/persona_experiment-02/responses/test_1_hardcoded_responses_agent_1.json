  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of three properties simultaneously:\\n\\n**Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously. Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: The system remains operational and responsive. Every request receives a response, without guarantee of the most recent data.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues operating despite network failures or communication breakdowns between nodes.\\n\\n**Practical Implications**:\\n\\n*CP Systems* (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Traditional RDBMS with ACID properties, MongoDB with strong consistency. These sacrifice availability during network partitions but ensure data correctness.\\n\\n*AP Systems* (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Cassandra, DynamoDB, eventual consistency systems. These remain available during partitions but may serve stale data.\\n\\n*CA Systems* (Consistency + Availability): Theoretical in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable in real-world deployments.\\n\\n**Engineering Decisions**: The theorem forces architectural choices based on business requirements. Financial systems typically choose CP for correctness, while social media platforms choose AP for user experience. Modern approaches like CRDTs and vector clocks attempt to minimize these trade-offs through clever data structures and conflict resolution strategies.",
  
  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires attention to multiple attack vectors and following current security best practices:\\n\\n**Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** (RFC 7636):\\n```\\n1. Generate code_verifier (cryptographically random 43-128 chars)\\n2. Create code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))\\n3. Redirect to authorization server with code_challenge\\n4. Exchange authorization code + code_verifier for tokens\\n```\\n\\n**Critical Security Measures**:\\n\\n*State Parameter*: Always use cryptographically random state values to prevent CSRF attacks. Validate state on callback.\\n\\n*Redirect URI Validation*: Implement exact string matching for redirect URIs. Use allowlist approach, never wildcards.\\n\\n*Token Storage*: Store access tokens in memory only. Use httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies for refresh tokens. Implement proper token rotation.\\n\\n*Scope Principle*: Request minimal necessary scopes. Implement scope validation on resource servers.\\n\\n**Implementation Patterns**:\\n\\n*Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)*: Handle OAuth flows server-side, expose session cookies to frontend. Prevents token exposure to browser.\\n\\n*Token Introspection*: Use RFC 7662 for real-time token validation in microservices architectures.\\n\\n*JWT Considerations*: If using JWT tokens, validate signatures, check exp/nbf claims, implement proper key rotation. Consider opaque tokens for better revocation control.\\n\\n**Common Vulnerabilities**: Avoid implicit flow, validate all redirect URIs, implement proper CORS policies, use TLS 1.2+, and regularly audit dependencies for security updates.",
  
  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For a startup frontend choice, consider these practical factors:\\n\\n**Choose React if**:\\n- You need the largest talent pool for hiring\\n- Plan to build mobile apps (React Native integration)\\n- Require extensive third-party library ecosystem\\n- Team has strong JavaScript fundamentals\\n- Building complex state management applications\\n\\n**Choose Vue if**:\\n- Team includes developers new to modern frameworks\\n- You want faster development velocity initially\\n- Building content-heavy or marketing sites\\n- Prefer convention over configuration\\n- Working with existing jQuery/legacy codebases\\n\\n**Startup-Specific Considerations**:\\n\\n*Time to Market*: Vue's learning curve is gentler, potentially faster initial development.

Vue developers may be harder to find but often more cost-effective.\\n\\n*Scaling Concerns*: Both handle enterprise scale well. React has more established patterns for large applications.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Choose React if you're building a complex SaaS product or plan significant mobile development. Choose Vue if you prioritize development speed, have junior developers, or are building content-focused applications.\\n\\n**Next Steps**: Build a small prototype in both frameworks over 2-3 days. Evaluate which feels more natural for your team's workflow and project requirements. The technology choice matters less than execution quality and team productivity.",
