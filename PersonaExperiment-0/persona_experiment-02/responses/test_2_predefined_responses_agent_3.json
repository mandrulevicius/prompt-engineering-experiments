  "query_1": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For GitHub Copilot in 2025, evaluate based on your needs: Individual developers can use the free tier with basic completions, Pro subscription ($10/month) offers advanced features and priority access, Business plan ($19/user/month) includes admin controls and team management, Enterprise provides custom pricing with enhanced security. Consider your coding frequency, team size, and budget. Free tier works for occasional use, but heavy developers benefit from Pro's unlimited completions and advanced AI models.",

  "query_2": "[Role: Domain Expert] OpenAI's 2025 developments center on GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities, showing marked improvements in complex problem-solving and multi-step reasoning tasks. The model architecture incorporates advances in attention mechanisms and training methodologies. GPT-4 variants received optimization updates for cost-effectiveness and specialized domain performance. Significant progress in AI safety research, including better alignment techniques and reduced harmful output generation. The company also expanded API offerings with more granular control and specialized endpoints for enterprise applications.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Socratic Guide] The CAP theorem presents a fundamental trade-off in distributed systems. Let's explore this: imagine you're designing a system that must work across multiple data centers. If the network connection between them fails (partition), what should happen? Should all locations stop accepting writes to maintain consistency, or continue operating with potentially inconsistent data? This choice defines your system's behavior. Real applications rarely need perfect consistency everywhere - consider which data requires strict consistency versus what can be eventually consistent. What consistency guarantees do your users actually need?",

  "query_4": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For secure OAuth 2.0 implementation, prioritize these steps: implement HTTPS everywhere with certificate validation, use authorization code flow with PKCE (never implicit flow), validate redirect URIs against strict whitelists, implement proper state parameter handling, secure token storage using httpOnly cookies or encrypted storage, implement token refresh with automatic rotation, validate JWT tokens including signature verification and expiration, implement proper scope validation, use short-lived access tokens, and maintain comprehensive logging for security monitoring. Test thoroughly against OWASP OAuth security guidelines.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Choosing between React and Vue for your startup involves balancing immediate needs with future scalability. React offers a massive ecosystem, abundant talent pool, and strong corporate backing, making it safer for long-term hiring and maintenance. Vue provides gentler learning curves and faster initial development, ideal for small teams needing rapid iteration. Consider creating small prototypes in both to evaluate team productivity and comfort. Factor in your team's JavaScript experience, project complexity, timeline pressures, and long-term technical vision when making this foundational decision.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Approach salary negotiations as a collaborative problem-solving exercise rather than adversarial confrontation. Research thoroughly using multiple salary data sources, document your unique contributions and impact metrics, identify the company's financial health and budget cycles, prepare multiple value propositions beyond base salary (equity, professional development, flexibility), practice articulating your case clearly and confidently, consider the hiring manager's constraints and perspective, develop creative compensation packages if cash is limited, and maintain positive relationships throughout the process regardless of immediate outcomes.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Starting machine learning requires a structured approach: begin with Python fundamentals and basic statistics, progress through hands-on courses like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning or Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning, practice with real datasets using Jupyter notebooks and scikit-learn, focus on understanding when to apply different algorithms rather than memorizing formulas, work on end-to-end projects from data collection to model deployment, join ML communities for support and feedback, and gradually progress from supervised learning to more advanced topics. Set realistic timelines - expect 6-12 months for foundational competency.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Systematic Node.js performance debugging involves: profiling CPU usage with built-in --prof flag or clinic.js flame graphs, monitoring memory patterns using heap snapshots and tracking garbage collection, identifying event loop blocking with --trace-warnings, analyzing database query performance and connection pooling efficiency, reviewing asynchronous code patterns for proper error handling, implementing application-level monitoring with tools like New Relic or DataDog, load testing to identify bottlenecks under stress, and optimizing based on actual metrics rather than assumptions. Start with the most critical user-facing performance issues.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Successfully advocating for AI adoption requires addressing executive concerns directly: demonstrate clear ROI through measurable pilot projects, present competitive analysis showing industry adoption rates and risks of lagging behind, showcase specific use cases relevant to your business model, address job displacement concerns by emphasizing human-AI collaboration, provide realistic implementation timelines with defined success metrics, prepare budget projections including training and infrastructure costs, highlight compliance and security considerations, and offer to lead a small-scale proof of concept to minimize risk while proving value.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Understanding blockchain requires distinguishing hype from practical applications. Blockchain excels when you need trustless transactions, immutable audit trails, or removing intermediaries between parties who don't trust each other. It's valuable for supply chain transparency, digital asset ownership, cross-border payments, and decentralized identity systems. However, it's often overkill for applications requiring fast transactions, frequent data updates, or centralized control. Evaluate whether your use case actually benefits from decentralization's trade-offs in performance, cost, and complexity before committing to blockchain solutions.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Transforming team productivity requires understanding the human elements behind performance metrics. Look beyond surface symptoms to identify root causes: unclear priorities creating busy work, communication gaps causing duplicate efforts, inadequate tools forcing manual workarounds, or burnout from unsustainable pace. Solutions might include restructuring workflows for better focus time, implementing collaborative planning sessions, investing in automation and better tooling, creating psychological safety for honest feedback, or redesigning goals to emphasize impact over activity. Engage the team in diagnosing and solving productivity challenges together.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Python's appeal lies in its philosophy of prioritizing human readability and developer happiness over machine efficiency. It's a language designed for collaboration and rapid iteration, with syntax that reads almost like natural language. This makes it exceptional for prototyping ideas, data exploration, automation scripts, and educational purposes. Python's 'batteries included' standard library and rich ecosystem enable quick solutions across domains from web development to artificial intelligence. While not the fastest language, Python's ability to accelerate development cycles and facilitate team collaboration often provides greater overall value than raw execution speed."
