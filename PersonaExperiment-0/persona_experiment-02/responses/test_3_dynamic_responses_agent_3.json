  "query_3": "[Role: Systems Architecture Theorist] The CAP theorem articulates a fundamental impossibility result in distributed computing: networked systems cannot simultaneously guarantee **Consistency** (instantaneous data uniformity across nodes), **Availability** (continuous system responsiveness), and **Partition tolerance** (operation despite network segmentation). This constraint manifests in real-world architectures as distinct trade-off patterns: CP systems like traditional ACID-compliant databases prioritize data consistency but sacrifice availability during network disruptions; AP systems such as Cassandra and DynamoDB maintain operational availability while accepting eventual consistency; CA systems remain theoretical constructs since network partitions are inevitable in distributed environments. Contemporary systems navigate these constraints through sophisticated techniques including eventual consistency frameworks, BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) principles, vector clock synchronization, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and consensus algorithms like Raft and Paxos that enable intelligent trade-off management based on application requirements and operational contexts.",
