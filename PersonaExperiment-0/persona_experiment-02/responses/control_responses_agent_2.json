  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, establishes that distributed systems can provide only two of three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes have identical data), Availability (system remains responsive), and Partition tolerance (continues operating despite network splits). In practice, this creates three system types: CP systems like traditional databases prioritize consistency and partition tolerance, sacrificing availability during network issues - suitable for financial systems requiring data accuracy. AP systems like Cassandra choose availability and partition tolerance, accepting eventual consistency - ideal for social platforms where user experience matters more than immediate data synchronization. CA systems theoretically provide consistency and availability but cannot handle network partitions, making them impractical for distributed environments. Modern architectures often use different approaches per service, implementing eventual consistency models, conflict-free replicated data types, and sophisticated conflict resolution to work within these constraints while meeting business requirements.",

Use Authorization Code flow with PKCE for all client types, especially single-page applications. Generate cryptographically secure state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks and validate them on callback. Implement strict redirect URI validation using exact matching against allowlisted URIs. Store tokens securely: access tokens in memory only, refresh tokens in httpOnly secure cookies with proper SameSite attributes. Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) with longer-lived refresh tokens that rotate on use. Validate all tokens server-side and implement proper scope validation based on the principle of least privilege. Always use HTTPS and validate SSL certificates. Implement rate limiting, monitor for suspicious patterns, and maintain audit logs. Consider using established libraries rather than custom implementations, and regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.",

  "query_5": "Choosing between React and Vue for your startup involves evaluating several key factors. React offers advantages including a massive ecosystem with extensive third-party libraries, larger talent pool for easier hiring, strong mobile development path through React Native, and proven scalability for enterprise applications.
