  "query_2": "[Role: Emerging AI Technologies Reporter] OpenAI's 2025 developments have been groundbreaking, headlined by GPT-5's August launch as their most sophisticated unified model yet. GPT-5 demonstrates remarkable capabilities: 94.6% accuracy on AIME 2025 mathematics problems, 74.9% success rate on SWE-bench coding challenges, and a substantial ~45% reduction in hallucinations versus GPT-4o. The company also unveiled GPT-4.5 as a research preview and the GPT-4.1 series, including mini and nano variants with enhanced coding and instruction-following abilities. For the first time, GPT-5 is accessible to all ChatGPT users, including free tier users, while Microsoft integrates it throughout their ecosystem. The platform now serves nearly 700 million weekly users, marking unprecedented adoption in AI assistance technology.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Database Systems Theory Expert] The CAP theorem establishes a fundamental constraint in distributed computing: any networked data system can simultaneously provide only two of three guarantees - **Consistency** (uniform data across all nodes), **Availability** (continuous system operation), and **Partition tolerance** (resilience to network failures). In practice, this creates distinct system archetypes: CP systems like traditional RDBMS prioritize consistency but may become unavailable during network splits; AP systems like Cassandra and DynamoDB maintain availability by accepting eventual consistency; CA systems are theoretical impossibilities in truly distributed environments since network partitions are unavoidable. Modern implementations employ sophisticated strategies including eventual consistency models, BASE principles, vector clocks, CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), and consensus protocols like Raft and Paxos to navigate these inherent trade-offs intelligently.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Application Security Architect] Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation demands adherence to multiple critical practices: **Mandatory PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for all client types, particularly SPAs and mobile applications; **Robust state parameter implementation** to mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities; **Short-lived access tokens** (15-60 minutes) paired with securely stored refresh tokens; **Strict redirect URI validation** with mandatory HTTPS enforcement; **Granular scope validation** following least privilege principles; **Secure client secret management** (never exposed in client-side code); **Secure token storage strategies** (httpOnly cookies for web, secure enclaves for mobile); **Rate limiting and anomaly detection** for suspicious authentication patterns; **Proper JWT validation** including signature verification and claims validation; **Leveraging established authorization servers** like Auth0, Okta, or AWS Cognito rather than custom implementations. Always comply with RFC 6749 specifications and security guidelines from RFC 6819.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technology Decision Consultant] For startup environments, I strongly advocate **React** due to several strategic advantages: significantly larger talent pool facilitating easier recruitment, comprehensive ecosystem with mature tooling, stronger enterprise adoption ensuring long-term viability, and robust community support. React's learning curve is reasonable, offers excellent TypeScript integration, and frameworks like Next.js provide comprehensive full-stack capabilities. **Consider Vue when**: your team prioritizes development velocity over ecosystem breadth, you're building focused applications with limited scope, or your developers prefer Vue's template-driven approach and gentler onboarding experience. Vue 3's Composition API is technically excellent, but the ecosystem and talent market remain more constrained. Strategic recommendation: React for venture-backed startups requiring rapid scaling and easy talent acquisition; Vue for bootstrapped startups emphasizing developer experience and rapid initial delivery. While both are technically sound, React's ecosystem advantages typically outweigh Vue's simplicity benefits for growth-oriented startups.",
