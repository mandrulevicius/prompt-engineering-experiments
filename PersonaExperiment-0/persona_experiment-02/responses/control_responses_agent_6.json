  "query_3": "The CAP theorem establishes a fundamental limitation in distributed system design, proving that simultaneous guarantees of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance are mathematically impossible. Consistency requires all system nodes to maintain identical data states; Availability demands continuous operational responsiveness; Partition tolerance ensures functionality despite network communication breakdowns. This constraint results in three practical system classifications: CP systems such as MongoDB with strong consistency configurations prioritize data accuracy and partition handling while potentially compromising availability during network disruptions - appropriate for financial applications where data correctness is essential. AP systems like Cassandra emphasize continuous availability and partition resilience while accepting eventual consistency models - ideal for social media platforms where user experience supersedes immediate data synchronization. CA systems theoretically provide both consistency and availability but fail during network partitions, rendering them impractical for truly distributed deployments. Contemporary architectures often implement different CAP strategies per microservice component, employing eventual consistency patterns, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and advanced conflict resolution algorithms to minimize trade-off impacts while meeting specific business and technical requirements.",

  "query_4": "Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires meticulous attention to established security protocols and comprehensive threat mitigation strategies. Consistently use Authorization Code flow combined with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), particularly essential for single-page applications and mobile clients where client secrets cannot be securely stored. Generate cryptographically strong, unpredictable state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks and implement rigorous validation during authorization server callbacks. Establish strict redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-configured allowlists, avoiding wildcards or pattern-based matching that could introduce vulnerabilities. Implement secure token management practices: maintain access tokens exclusively in application memory with short lifespans, store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies with appropriate expiration policies. Deploy short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) paired with longer-duration refresh tokens that implement rotation policies upon each usage. Validate all tokens exclusively on server-side components and enforce granular scope validation strictly adhering to least privilege access principles. Ensure comprehensive HTTPS implementation with proper SSL certificate validation and current TLS versions. Implement robust rate limiting mechanisms, continuous monitoring for suspicious access patterns, and comprehensive audit logging for security analysis. Prioritize well-established, community-vetted OAuth libraries over custom implementations and maintain current versions to address emerging security vulnerabilities and protocol updates.",

  "query_5": "The React versus Vue framework decision for startups requires careful evaluation of multiple technical and strategic factors that will impact both immediate development and long-term project success. React offers substantial advantages including an extensive ecosystem with countless third-party libraries and components, a significantly larger talent pool of experienced developers facilitating team growth, comprehensive mobile development capabilities through React Native for cross-platform applications, and demonstrated scalability for complex, enterprise-level applications. However, React presents a steeper initial learning curve and requires more configuration and setup overhead. Vue provides more accessible developer onboarding with gentler learning progression, exceptional documentation quality that accelerates development, faster initial project setup through opinionated conventions and sensible defaults, and typically superior performance characteristics out-of-the-box for standard web applications. Trade-offs include a comparatively smaller ecosystem and more limited availability of experienced Vue developers in the job market. For startup environments, carefully assess current team expertise levels and learning capacity, project complexity and scalability requirements, development timeline constraints and time-to-market pressures, and future hiring and team scaling projections. Vue often excels for smaller, cohesive teams developing straightforward to moderately complex applications with rapid development timelines, while React may better serve highly complex applications, teams planning significant growth, or projects requiring extensive third-party integration and mobile development capabilities through React Native's mature ecosystem.",
