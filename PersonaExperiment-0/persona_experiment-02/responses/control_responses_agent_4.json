  "query_3": "The CAP theorem establishes a fundamental trade-off in distributed systems: you can guarantee at most two of Consistency (all nodes see the same data), Availability (system stays operational), and Partition tolerance (works despite network failures). This creates practical system categories: CP systems like traditional ACID databases prioritize data consistency and can handle network partitions but may become unavailable during failures - appropriate for financial systems where data accuracy is critical. AP systems like Cassandra choose availability and partition tolerance, accepting eventual consistency - suitable for social media where continuous service matters more than immediate data synchronization. CA systems theoretically provide consistency and availability but cannot handle network partitions, making them unsuitable for distributed deployments. Modern approaches use different strategies per service component, implementing eventual consistency models, conflict resolution algorithms, and techniques like CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to work within these constraints while meeting business needs.",

  "query_4": "Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires following established security best practices to prevent common attack vectors. Always use Authorization Code flow with PKCE, particularly for public clients and SPAs. Generate cryptographically secure state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks and validate them on callback. Implement strict redirect URI validation using exact matches against a pre-approved allowlist. Handle token storage securely: keep access tokens in memory only, use httpOnly secure cookies with SameSite attributes for refresh tokens. Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) with longer refresh tokens that rotate on each use. Validate all tokens on the server side and implement proper scope validation following least privilege principles. Ensure HTTPS everywhere with proper certificate validation. Add rate limiting, monitor for suspicious activity, and maintain audit logs. Use well-vetted OAuth libraries rather than custom implementations, and keep all dependencies updated. Consider OpenID Connect for authentication scenarios, and implement proper token revocation and cleanup on logout.",
