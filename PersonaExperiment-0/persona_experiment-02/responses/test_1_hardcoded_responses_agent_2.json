  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem establishes fundamental constraints in distributed system architecture, proving that simultaneous guarantees of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance are mathematically impossible. Consistency requires all nodes to maintain identical data states; Availability demands continuous system responsiveness; Partition tolerance ensures operation despite network communication failures. This creates three practical system categories: CP systems like traditional RDBMS prioritize data accuracy and partition handling while potentially sacrificing availability during network disruptions - essential for financial systems where correctness is paramount. AP systems such as Cassandra emphasize continuous availability and partition resilience while accepting eventual consistency - ideal for social platforms prioritizing user experience. CA systems theoretically provide consistency and availability but fail during partitions, limiting distributed utility. Modern architectures employ different CAP strategies per microservice, utilizing eventual consistency patterns, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and sophisticated conflict resolution to minimize trade-off impacts while meeting business requirements.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] OAuth 2.0 security implementation requires rigorous adherence to current standards and comprehensive threat modeling. Always employ Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), particularly critical for single-page applications and mobile clients where client secrets cannot be securely stored. Generate cryptographically strong state parameters using secure random number generators to prevent CSRF attacks, validating them during authorization callbacks. Implement strict redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-configured allowlists, never employing wildcards or pattern matching. Secure token management is paramount: maintain access tokens exclusively in application memory with short lifespans (15-30 minutes), store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies with appropriate expiration policies. Validate all tokens server-side and enforce granular scope validation following least privilege principles. Ensure comprehensive HTTPS usage with current TLS versions and proper certificate validation. Deploy rate limiting, continuous monitoring for anomalous patterns, and comprehensive audit logging. Prioritize established OAuth libraries over custom implementations and maintain current versions to address emerging vulnerabilities.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] The React versus Vue decision for startups requires evaluating multiple strategic factors that impact both immediate development and long-term success. React's advantages include an extensive ecosystem with abundant third-party solutions, a large talent pool facilitating team growth, comprehensive mobile development through React Native, and proven enterprise scalability. However, it presents a steeper learning curve and requires more configuration overhead. Vue offers gentler developer onboarding, exceptional documentation quality, faster initial development through opinionated conventions, and superior out-of-box performance for typical applications. Trade-offs include a smaller ecosystem and limited experienced developer availability. For startups, assess team expertise levels, project complexity requirements, development timeline constraints, and hiring projections. Vue excels for cohesive teams building straightforward applications rapidly, while React suits complex applications or scenarios requiring significant team scaling and mobile development capabilities.",
