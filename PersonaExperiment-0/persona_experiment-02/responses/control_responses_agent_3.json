  "query_3": "The CAP theorem fundamentally constrains distributed system design by proving you cannot simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Consistency requires all nodes to reflect identical data states; Availability demands continuous system responsiveness; Partition tolerance enables operation despite network failures. Real-world systems must choose two properties: CP systems like MongoDB with strong consistency settings sacrifice availability during partitions to maintain data accuracy, making them suitable for financial applications where correctness is paramount. AP systems such as Cassandra prioritize continuous operation and partition resilience, accepting eventual consistency - ideal for social media platforms where user experience trumps immediate data synchronization. CA systems providing both consistency and availability cannot handle network partitions, limiting their use in truly distributed environments. Modern architectures often employ different CAP choices per microservice, utilizing techniques like eventual consistency, vector clocks, and conflict-free replicated data types to minimize trade-off impacts while meeting specific business requirements.",

  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely demands adherence to current security standards and threat mitigation practices. Employ Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) universally, especially for single-page applications and mobile clients. Generate cryptographically strong state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks, validating them upon authorization callback. Implement stringent redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-approved allowlists, never wildcards. Secure token storage is critical: maintain access tokens in memory only, store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies. Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) paired with longer refresh tokens that rotate upon use. Validate all tokens server-side and enforce granular scope validation following least privilege principles. Maintain HTTPS throughout and validate SSL certificates rigorously. Deploy rate limiting, monitor for anomalous access patterns, and maintain comprehensive audit trails. Prioritize battle-tested OAuth libraries over custom implementations and maintain current dependency versions to address security vulnerabilities promptly.",

  "query_5": "The React versus Vue decision for startups hinges on several strategic considerations. React's strengths include an expansive ecosystem with abundant third-party solutions, a large developer talent pool facilitating hiring, seamless mobile development through React Native, and proven enterprise scalability. The learning curve is steeper and requires more boilerplate, but the investment pays dividends for complex applications. Vue offers more approachable onboarding, exceptional documentation, rapid initial development through opinionated conventions, and superior out-of-box performance for typical use cases. However, it features a smaller ecosystem and limited developer availability. For startups, evaluate team expertise levels, project complexity requirements, hiring timelines, and growth projections. Vue often excels for smaller teams building straightforward applications rapidly, while React may better serve complex applications or scenarios requiring rapid team scaling. Consider also your mobile strategy - if native mobile apps are planned, React's ecosystem advantage becomes more pronounced through React Native's mature toolchain.",
