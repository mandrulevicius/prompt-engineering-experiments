  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem represents a fundamental theoretical constraint in distributed systems engineering, formally proving that distributed data systems cannot simultaneously achieve Consistency (linearizable read/write operations), Availability (guaranteed response to every request), and Partition tolerance (continued operation despite network failures). This impossibility result creates three practical system architectures: CP systems prioritizing Consistency and Partition tolerance while potentially sacrificing Availability during network disruptions - exemplified by traditional RDBMS with ACID properties or MongoDB in strong consistency mode, essential for financial systems where data accuracy and transactional integrity are non-negotiable requirements. AP systems emphasizing Availability and Partition tolerance while accepting eventual consistency models - represented by systems like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB, appropriate for social media platforms, content delivery networks, or applications where continuous user experience outweighs immediate data synchronization across all nodes. CA systems theoretically providing Consistency and Availability but failing during network partitions, making them unsuitable for genuinely distributed environments where network failures are inevitable. Modern distributed architectures often implement different CAP trade-offs per microservice or data type, employing sophisticated techniques including eventual consistency with conflict resolution, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), vector clocks for causality tracking, and multi-version concurrency control to minimize the practical impact of these theoretical limitations while satisfying specific business requirements and performance characteristics.",
