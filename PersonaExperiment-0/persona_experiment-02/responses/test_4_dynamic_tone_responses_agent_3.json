  "query_3": "[Role: Systems Architecture Consultant] The CAP theorem provides essential guidance for designing distributed systems by illuminating fundamental trade-offs:\n\n**Theorem Foundation:**\nIn any distributed data system, you can simultaneously guarantee at most two of these three critical properties:\n- **Consistency**: All nodes return identical data for concurrent reads\n- **Availability**: System responds to requests despite node failures\n- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues operating despite network communication failures\n\n**System Design Categories:**\n\n**CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**\n- **Examples**: MongoDB with strong consistency, Redis Cluster, Apache HBase\n- **Behavior**: Prioritizes data accuracy over availability during network partitions\n- **Applications**: Financial transactions, inventory management, regulatory systems, banking operations\n- **Trade-off**: May become unavailable during network issues to maintain data consistency\n\n**AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**\n- **Examples**: Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, CouchDB, Riak\n- **Behavior**: Maintains service availability but may serve inconsistent data during partitions\n- **Applications**: Social media platforms, content delivery networks, analytics systems, recommendation engines\n- **Trade-off**: Temporary data inconsistency in exchange for continuous service availability\n\n**CA Systems (Consistency + Availability):**\n- **Examples**: Traditional single-node RDBMS, in-memory databases\n- **Reality**: True distributed CA systems cannot exist due to inevitable network partitions\n- **Modern Context**: Systems optimized for CA within single data center boundaries\n\n**Practical Implementation Strategies:**\n\n**E-commerce Platform Architecture:**\n```\nProduct Catalog Service: AP System\n- High availability critical for customer browsing\n- Slight data staleness acceptable for product information\n- Implementation: DynamoDB with eventual consistency\n\nInventory Management: CP System\n- Data consistency essential to prevent overselling\n- Brief unavailability acceptable during network issues\n- Implementation: MongoDB with strong consistency guarantees\n\nUser Session Management: AP System\n- Service availability critical for user experience\n- Session data can tolerate brief inconsistencies\n- Implementation: Redis with clustering for high availability\n\nPayment Processing: CP System\n- Financial accuracy absolutely critical\n- System can wait for network recovery before processing\n- Implementation: PostgreSQL with synchronous replication\n```\n\n**Advanced Design Patterns:**\n\n**Microservices CAP Strategy:**\nDifferent services within the same application can choose different CAP trade-offs based on business requirements:\n- **User Profile Service**: AP (availability for user experience)\n- **Order Processing**: CP (consistency for business integrity)\n- **Recommendation Engine**: AP (availability for engagement)\n- **Audit Logging**: CP (consistency for compliance)\n\n**Modern Consistency Models:**\n- **Eventual Consistency**: Popular AP approach allowing temporary inconsistency\n- **Strong Consistency**: CP approach guaranteeing immediate consistency\n- **Bounded Staleness**: Configurable consistency with time or version bounds\n- **Session Consistency**: Consistency guarantees within user sessions\n\n**BASE vs ACID:**\n- **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability): Traditional database approach\n- **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency): Distributed systems approach\n\n**Industry Evolution:**\nMany modern distributed systems offer tunable consistency, allowing developers to choose appropriate CAP trade-offs per operation or data type. Technologies like Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, and Microsoft Cosmos DB provide configurable consistency levels.\n\n**Decision Framework:**\nWhen designing distributed systems, evaluate each data type and operation against these questions:\n1. Can this data tolerate temporary inconsistency?\n2. Is continuous availability more important than perfect consistency?\n3. How does network partition impact business operations?\n4. What are the regulatory or compliance requirements?\n\nUnderstanding CAP theorem enables architects to make informed decisions about data consistency requirements versus availability needs, ensuring system designs align with business priorities and operational constraints.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Cybersecurity Implementation Specialist] Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires careful attention to the authorization code flow and comprehensive security controls:\n\n**Secure Authorization Code Flow:**\n\n**1. Client Application Setup:**\n- Register application with authorization server to obtain client credentials\n- Configure exact-match redirect URIs (no wildcards or pattern matching)\n- Implement HTTPS for all OAuth endpoints and communication\n- Securely store client secrets server-side only (never in client-side code)\n\n**2. Authorization Request with Security Enhancements:**\n```\nAuthorization URL Construction:\nhttps://auth.provider.com/oauth/authorize?\n  response_type=code&\n  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&\n  redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback&\n  scope=profile email&\n  state=CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY_RANDOM_STATE&\n  code_challenge=BASE64URL_ENCODED_CHALLENGE&\n  code_challenge_method=S256\n\n// PKCE parameter generation\nconst codeVerifier = base64url(crypto.randomBytes(32));\nconst codeChallenge = base64url(crypto.createHash('sha256').update(codeVerifier).digest());\nconst state = base64url(crypto.randomBytes(16));\n```\n\n**3. Secure Token Exchange:**\n```\nPOST /oauth/token\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAuthorization: Basic BASE64(client_id:client_secret)\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code&\ncode=RECEIVED_AUTHORIZATION_CODE&\nredirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback&\ncode_verifier=ORIGINAL_CODE_VERIFIER\n```\n\n**Critical Security Implementations:**\n\n**PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):**\n```javascript\n// Generate code verifier and challenge\nfunction generatePKCE() {\n  const codeVerifier = base64url(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)));\n  const encoder = new TextEncoder();\n  const data = encoder.encode(codeVerifier);\n  \n  return crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data).then(hash => {\n    const codeChallenge = base64url(new Uint8Array(hash));\n    return { codeVerifier, codeChallenge };\n  });\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: Prevents authorization code interception attacks\n- **Requirement**: Mandatory for public clients, strongly recommended for all implementations\n- **Method**: Use S256 (SHA256) challenge method, avoid plain text\n\n**State Parameter for CSRF Protection:**\n```javascript\n// Generate and validate state parameter\nfunction generateState() {\n  return base64url(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16)));\n}\n\nfunction validateState(receivedState, sessionState) {\n  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(\n    Buffer.from(receivedState),\n    Buffer.from(sessionState)\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Secure Token Storage & Management:**\n\n**Access Token Security:**\n```javascript\n// Secure token storage options\nclass TokenManager {\n  // Option 1: Memory storage (most secure, lost on refresh)\n  storeInMemory(token) {\n    this.accessToken = token;\n  }\n  \n  // Option 2: Secure HTTP-only cookie\n  storeInCookie(response, token) {\n    response.cookie('access_token', token, {\n      httpOnly: true,\n

'hex');\n    const tag = Buffer.from(parts[1], 'hex');\n    const encrypted = parts[2];\n    const decipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes-256-gcm', key);\n    decipher.setAuthTag(tag);\n    let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');\n    decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');\n    return decrypted;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Advanced Security Measures:**\n\n**JWT Token Validation:**\n```javascript\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\n\nfunction validateJWT(token, publicKey) {\n  try {\n    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey, {\n      algorithms: ['RS256', 'ES256'], // Specify allowed algorithms\n      issuer: 'https://trusted-auth-server.com',\n      audience: 'your-application-id',\n      clockTolerance: 60 // Allow 60 seconds clock skew\n    });\n    \n    // Validate custom claims\n    if (decoded.exp < Date.now() / 1000) {\n      throw new Error('Token expired');\n    }\n    \n    return decoded;\n  } catch (error) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid token: ' + error.message);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Rate Limiting & Monitoring:**\n```javascript\nconst rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\n\n// Rate limiting for OAuth endpoints\nconst oauthLimiter = rateLimit({\n  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes\n  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs\n  message: 'Too many OAuth requests from this IP',\n  standardHeaders: true,\n  legacyHeaders: false\n});\n\n// Security monitoring\nfunction logSecurityEvent(event, details) {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify({\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    event: event,\n    details: details,\n    severity: 'SECURITY'\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Best Practices:**\n\n**Redirect URI Security:**\n- Use exact string matching for redirect URI validation\n- Avoid HTTP URLs in production (HTTPS only)\n- Implement allowlist of trusted redirect URIs\n- Validate redirect URI on both authorization and token endpoints\n\n**Scope Management:**\n- Implement principle of least privilege\n- Validate requested scopes against client permissions\n- Use granular scopes rather than broad permissions\n- Regularly audit and rotate scope definitions\n\n**Security Monitoring:**\n- Log all OAuth authentication events\n- Monitor for suspicious patterns (multiple failed attempts, unusual locations)\n- Implement alerting for security anomalies\n- Regular security audits and penetration testing\n\n**Common Security Vulnerabilities to Prevent:**\n- Authorization code replay attacks (implement single-use codes)\n- Open redirect vulnerabilities in redirect_uri handling\n- Token leakage through application logs or error messages\n- Insufficient redirect URI validation allowing malicious redirects\n- Missing PKCE implementation in mobile and single-page applications\n- Weak state parameter generation or validation\n\nThis comprehensive security approach ensures OAuth 2.0 implementations provide robust protection against common attack vectors while maintaining good user experience and system reliability.",
