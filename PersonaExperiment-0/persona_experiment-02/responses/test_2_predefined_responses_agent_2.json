  "query_1": "[Role: Research Librarian] GitHub Copilot pricing structure for 2025 includes: Individual Free tier with monthly usage limits, Copilot Pro at $10/month for enhanced features, Copilot Business at $19/user/month for teams, and Copilot Enterprise with custom pricing for large organizations. The 2025 updates introduced usage-based billing for heavy users and integration with GitHub Actions for automated code reviews. Academic users continue to receive free access through GitHub Education programs.",

  "query_2": "[Role: Research Librarian] Recent OpenAI announcements in 2025 feature GPT-5's public release with improved reasoning capabilities, showing significant gains in mathematical problem-solving and code generation. GPT-4 Turbo received substantial updates for reduced latency and cost optimization. The company also launched specialized models for enterprise use cases and introduced new safety measures following increased regulatory scrutiny. ChatGPT usage has expanded to over 200 million weekly active users across consumer and business segments.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] CAP theorem fundamentally constrains distributed system design by proving that network partitions make it impossible to simultaneously maintain strong consistency and full availability. In practice, systems choose CP (consistency over availability) like MongoDB in certain configurations, or AP (availability over partition tolerance) like Cassandra or DynamoDB. Real-world implications include designing for eventual consistency, implementing conflict resolution strategies, using circuit breakers for fault tolerance, and carefully considering data consistency requirements versus user experience during network failures.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Implementing secure OAuth 2.0 requires several critical steps: Use the authorization code flow with PKCE for all client types, implement proper state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks, store tokens securely using httpOnly cookies or secure storage APIs, validate all redirect URIs against a strict whitelist, implement token refresh mechanisms with proper rotation, use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes), validate JWT signatures and claims thoroughly, implement proper logout with token revocation, and regularly audit your OAuth implementation for security vulnerabilities.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For startup frontend selection, React offers advantages in hiring, community support, and ecosystem maturity, making it ideal for rapid scaling and team growth. Vue provides simpler learning curves and faster initial development, better for smaller teams or rapid prototyping. Consider your team's current skills, timeline constraints, and long-term maintenance plans. React's JSX and functional patterns may require more training but offer better performance optimization tools. Vue's template syntax is more approachable but has a smaller talent pool. Evaluate based on your specific use case, team size, and growth projections.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Effective salary negotiation for senior engineers involves: comprehensive market research using multiple data sources, documenting quantifiable achievements and business impact, timing discussions strategically around performance cycles or successful project deliveries, considering total compensation including equity and benefits, preparing multiple negotiation scenarios with fallback positions, practicing your presentation to articulate value clearly, understanding company budget cycles and promotion processes, and maintaining positive relationships regardless of outcomes. Be prepared to discuss alternative arrangements if salary increases aren't immediately possible.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Beginning machine learning requires understanding your goals and current foundation. What problems are you hoping to solve? Are you more interested in understanding how algorithms work or applying them to real problems? Let's assess your mathematical background - are you comfortable with statistics, linear algebra, and calculus? Your programming experience will also shape our approach. We can start with conceptual understanding through visualization tools, move to hands-on projects with user-friendly libraries, or dive deeper into mathematical foundations depending on your interests and learning preferences.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Domain Expert] Node.js performance debugging requires systematic analysis: use built-in profiler (--prof) or tools like clinic.js to identify CPU hotspots, monitor memory usage patterns with heap dumps and tools like memwatch-next, analyze event loop performance using --trace-warnings and async_hooks, optimize database connections with pooling and query analysis, implement proper error handling to prevent crashes, use clustering for multi-core utilization, implement caching strategies appropriately, and monitor garbage collection patterns. Share specific symptoms like high memory usage, slow response times, or CPU spikes for targeted diagnostic approaches.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Building a compelling AI adoption case for your CEO requires strategic positioning: demonstrate clear ROI through pilot projects showing productivity improvements and cost reductions, present competitive analysis showing industry adoption trends and risks of falling behind, address specific business challenges AI can solve in your organization, create a phased implementation plan with measurable milestones, highlight employee retention benefits through upskilling opportunities, showcase risk mitigation through improved accuracy and consistency, and prepare for concerns about job displacement by emphasizing augmentation over replacement.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Understanding blockchain starts with examining why traditional databases might not suffice for certain use cases. What happens when multiple parties need to transact without trusting each other or a central authority? Blockchain addresses this through cryptographic proof and distributed consensus. But let's explore: when do you actually need these properties? Most applications don't require decentralization's trade-offs in terms of speed, cost, and complexity. What specific problems are you considering blockchain for? This will help determine whether blockchain's benefits outweigh its limitations in your context.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Team productivity challenges often reflect deeper systemic issues. What specific behaviors or outcomes are you observing? Are people busy but not accomplishing meaningful work? Is there confusion about priorities or roles? Let's explore the root causes: Are your processes creating bottlenecks? Do team members have the right tools and information? Is there clear alignment on goals? Understanding the underlying factors will help identify whether you need process changes, communication improvements, skill development, or organizational restructuring to address productivity effectively.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Domain Expert] Python is a versatile, interpreted language emphasizing readability and developer productivity. Its design philosophy prioritizes code clarity and simplicity, making it excellent for rapid prototyping and collaborative development. Python's strength lies in its extensive ecosystem: scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy), data analysis (pandas), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), web frameworks (Django, Flask), and automation tools. While execution speed can be limiting for computationally intensive tasks, Python's development speed and library ecosystem often provide net productivity gains. Modern Python features include type hints for better code maintainability and async/await for concurrent programming."
