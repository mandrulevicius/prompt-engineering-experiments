  "query_3": "The CAP theorem poses a fundamental constraint on distributed systems, proving that simultaneous achievement of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance is impossible. Consistency ensures all nodes reflect identical data states; Availability guarantees continuous system responsiveness; Partition tolerance maintains operation despite network communication failures. This creates three practical system architectures: CP systems like MongoDB with strong consistency settings prioritize data accuracy and partition handling while potentially sacrificing availability during network issues - ideal for financial systems where correctness is paramount. AP systems such as Cassandra emphasize continuous availability and partition resilience while accepting eventual consistency - perfect for social platforms where user experience outweighs immediate data synchronization. CA systems theoretically offer both consistency and availability but cannot handle network partitions, limiting their utility in genuinely distributed environments. Modern architectures often employ different CAP strategies per microservice, utilizing eventual consistency patterns, conflict-free replicated data types, and sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms to minimize trade-off impacts while satisfying specific business requirements.",

  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely demands strict adherence to current security standards and comprehensive threat mitigation. Always employ Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), especially crucial for single-page applications and mobile clients. Generate cryptographically robust state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks and rigorously validate them during authorization callbacks. Implement stringent redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-approved allowlists, never employing wildcards or pattern matching. Secure token management is critical: maintain access tokens exclusively in memory, store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies with appropriate expiration. Deploy short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) combined with longer-lived refresh tokens that rotate upon each usage. Validate all tokens exclusively server-side and enforce granular scope validation adhering to least privilege principles. Ensure comprehensive HTTPS usage with proper SSL certificate validation. Implement rate limiting, monitor for anomalous access patterns, and maintain detailed audit logging. Prioritize battle-tested OAuth libraries over custom implementations and maintain current versions to address emerging security vulnerabilities promptly.",

  "query_5": "The React versus Vue decision for startups involves evaluating multiple strategic and practical considerations. React provides significant advantages including an expansive ecosystem with abundant third-party libraries, a large pool of experienced developers facilitating recruitment, seamless mobile development through React Native, and demonstrated scalability for enterprise-level applications. However, it presents a steeper learning curve and requires more initial configuration. Vue offers more accessible onboarding for developers, exceptional documentation quality, accelerated initial development through opinionated conventions, and typically superior out-of-box performance for standard applications. The trade-offs include a smaller ecosystem and more limited developer availability in the job market. For startups, carefully assess team expertise levels, project complexity requirements, development timeline constraints, and scaling projections. Vue often excels for smaller teams developing straightforward applications rapidly, while React may better serve complex applications or scenarios requiring rapid team expansion. Additionally, consider your mobile development strategy - if native mobile applications are planned, React's ecosystem advantage becomes more pronounced through React Native's mature development toolchain and community support.",
