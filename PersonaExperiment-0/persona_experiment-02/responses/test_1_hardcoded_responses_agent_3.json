With ChatGPT approaching 700 million weekly active users and Microsoft's comprehensive platform integration, OpenAI continues advancing both technological capability and global accessibility to cutting-edge AI systems.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by computer scientist Eric Brewer, establishes a fundamental impossibility result in distributed systems theory: no distributed system can simultaneously guarantee Consistency (all nodes observe identical data), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (continues functioning despite network failures). This theoretical constraint manifests in practical system design decisions: CP systems such as traditional ACID-compliant databases prioritize data consistency and partition tolerance while potentially sacrificing availability during network disruptions - essential for financial applications where data accuracy is non-negotiable. AP systems like Apache Cassandra emphasize availability and partition tolerance while accepting eventual consistency models - appropriate for social media platforms where continuous user experience outweighs immediate data synchronization. CA systems theoretically provide consistency and availability but cannot handle network partitions, making them unsuitable for truly distributed deployments. Modern distributed architectures often employ different CAP trade-offs per microservice, utilizing eventual consistency patterns, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), vector clocks, and sophisticated conflict resolution algorithms to minimize the practical impact of these theoretical constraints while satisfying specific business and technical requirements.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires comprehensive understanding of the protocol's security model and adherence to current best practices established by RFC 6749 and subsequent security advisories. Always employ Authorization Code flow combined with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange, RFC 7636), particularly essential for public clients including single-page applications and mobile applications where client secrets cannot be securely stored. Generate cryptographically strong, unpredictable state parameters using secure random number generators to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, and implement rigorous validation of these parameters during authorization server callbacks. Establish strict redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-configured allowlists, never employing wildcards, regex patterns, or dynamic URI construction that could introduce open redirect vulnerabilities. Implement secure token management practices: maintain access tokens exclusively in application memory with short lifespans (typically 15-30 minutes), store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies with appropriate expiration policies to prevent XSS attacks. Deploy comprehensive server-side token validation and enforce granular scope validation strictly following least privilege access principles. Ensure end-to-end HTTPS implementation with current TLS versions and proper certificate validation. Implement robust rate limiting mechanisms, continuous monitoring for anomalous access patterns, and comprehensive audit logging for security analysis and compliance requirements.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Selecting between React and Vue for your startup requires careful evaluation of multiple technical, strategic, and organizational factors that will impact both immediate development velocity and long-term project sustainability. React offers significant advantages including an expansive ecosystem with extensive third-party libraries and components, a substantially larger pool of experienced developers facilitating recruitment and team scaling, comprehensive mobile development capabilities through React Native enabling cross-platform applications, and demonstrated scalability for complex, enterprise-level applications with proven architectural patterns. However, React presents challenges including a steeper initial learning curve, more complex initial setup requirements, and greater configuration overhead.
