  "query_2": "OpenAI made significant announcements in 2025, most notably the launch of GPT-5 in August 2025, which they describe as their 'best AI system yet.' GPT-5 features state-of-the-art performance across coding (74.9% on SWE-bench Verified), mathematics (94.6% on AIME 2025), writing, health, and visual perception. It's 45% less likely to hallucinate than GPT-4o and 80% less likely than OpenAI o3 when using reasoning. Earlier in 2025, OpenAI also released GPT-4.5 as a research preview and the GPT-4.1 series (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano) which outperform GPT-4o across the board. GPT-5 is now available to all ChatGPT users, including free users, marking the first time free users have access to a reasoning model. Microsoft is integrating GPT-5 across its platforms, and ChatGPT is expected to reach 700 million weekly active users.",

  "query_3": "The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practical implications include: For banking systems, you typically choose Consistency + Partition tolerance, accepting temporary unavailability during network issues to ensure data accuracy. Social media platforms often choose Availability + Partition tolerance, allowing eventual consistency where users might temporarily see different data. Traditional SQL databases prioritize Consistency + Availability in single-node scenarios but must sacrifice one when distributed. NoSQL databases like Cassandra (AP) or MongoDB (CP by default) are designed around these trade-offs. Modern approaches use techniques like eventual consistency, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and microservices with different CAP choices per service. Understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about database selection, system design, and acceptable trade-offs based on business requirements.",

  "query_4": "To implement OAuth 2.0 securely, follow these key practices: Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients and SPAs. Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. Implement proper token storage - use httpOnly, secure cookies for web apps or secure storage APIs for mobile. Set short expiration times for access tokens (15-60 minutes) and longer for refresh tokens. Validate all tokens on the server side and never trust client-side validation. Use HTTPS everywhere and validate SSL certificates. Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege. Store client secrets securely (never in client-side code) and rotate them regularly. Validate redirect URIs against a whitelist and use exact matching. Implement rate limiting and monitor for suspicious activity. Handle token revocation properly and clear tokens on logout. Use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than rolling your own implementation. Consider using OpenID Connect on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication use cases. Regularly audit your implementation and keep dependencies updated.",

  "query_5": "The choice between React and Vue for your startup depends on several factors. React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market opportunities, and better performance for complex applications. It has strong backing from Meta, extensive third-party libraries, and is preferred for mobile development with React Native. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more boilerplate code. Vue provides gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and faster development for smaller teams. It offers better performance out-of-the-box for most applications and has a more opinionated structure that can speed development. However, it has a smaller ecosystem and fewer experienced developers available. For startups, consider: team expertise (choose what your team knows best), project complexity (React for complex, Vue for simpler), development speed needs (Vue generally faster to start), long-term scaling plans (React has more enterprise adoption), and hiring plans (React developers are more abundant). If you're building a simple to medium complexity app with a small team, Vue might be better. For complex applications or if you plan to scale the team quickly, React might be the safer choice.",

  "query_6": "Structure salary negotiations as a senior engineer by preparing thoroughly with market research using tools like levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind to understand compensation ranges for your role and location. Document your achievements with specific metrics, successful projects, and impact on business outcomes. Research the company's financial health, recent funding, and typical compensation structure. During negotiation, present your case professionally by leading with your value proposition, not personal financial needs. Negotiate total compensation, including base salary, equity, bonuses, and benefits. Be specific with numbers and justify them with market data and your contributions. Consider non-salary benefits like additional PTO, learning budget, flexible work arrangements, or title changes. Use collaborative language ('How can we make this work?') rather than ultimatums. Be prepared to negotiate multiple rounds - initial offers are rarely final. Have a clear walk-away number but don't reveal it early. If they can't meet your salary requirements, explore other valuable perks. Get final offers in writing before accepting. Remember timing matters - negotiate during performance reviews, after successful project completions, or during hiring processes when you have the most leverage.",

  "query_7": "Starting machine learning as a complete beginner, follow this structured path: Begin with foundations by learning Python programming (focus on NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries) and basic statistics/probability. Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera or the fast.ai Practical Deep Learning course. Start with supervised learning concepts like linear regression, decision trees, and classification. Use hands-on tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab (free GPU access), and datasets from Kaggle. Practice with beginner-friendly projects: predicting house prices, image classification with pre-trained models, or analyzing datasets you're interested in. Learn key libraries: Scikit-learn for traditional ML, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning. Focus on understanding when to use different algorithms rather than memorizing formulas. Join communities like Kaggle, Reddit's r/MachineLearning, or local ML meetups. Work on portfolio projects that demonstrate your skills with real data and clear explanations. Consider specializing based on interest: computer vision, natural language processing, or recommendation systems. Remember that ML is iterative - start simple, get results, then add complexity. The key is consistent practice with real projects rather than just theoretical study.",

  "query_8": "To debug Node.js performance issues systematically: First, identify the bottleneck using profiling tools like Node.js built-in profiler (--prof flag), clinic.js for comprehensive analysis, or New Relic/DataDog for production monitoring. Check common issues: memory leaks (use --inspect and Chrome DevTools heap profiler), blocking the event loop (use --trace-warnings), inefficient database queries (add query logging), and unoptimized algorithms. Use performance measurement tools like console.time(), process.hrtime.bigint(), or the perf_hooks module. Monitor key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, event loop lag, and response times. Common solutions include: implementing connection pooling for databases, adding caching layers (Redis), optimizing database queries with indexes, using streaming for large data processing, implementing pagination for large datasets, and clustering for CPU-intensive tasks. Check for: synchronous operations in async code, missing await keywords, inefficient JSON parsing, large object iterations, and memory-intensive operations. Use tools like autocannon for load testing and 0x for flame graphs. Consider upgrading Node.js version, optimizing Docker containers if used, and implementing proper error handling to prevent cascading failures. Profile both development and production environments as they often behave differently.",

  "query_9": "To convince your CEO to adopt AI tools, build a business case focusing on ROI and competitive advantage. Start with pilot projects that demonstrate clear value: automate routine tasks (customer service chatbots, document processing), enhance decision-making (predictive analytics, market analysis), or improve product capabilities (recommendation engines, search optimization). Present concrete metrics: time savings, cost reduction, error rate improvements, and revenue increases from similar companies. Address CEO concerns directly: show how AI reduces operational costs, increases team productivity, and provides competitive differentiation. Use industry benchmarks showing companies using AI tools report 10-50% productivity gains in relevant areas. Propose a phased approach: start with low-risk, high-impact tools like GitHub Copilot for developers or AI writing assistants for marketing. Emphasize risk mitigation through proper governance, security measures, and gradual implementation. Present competitor analysis showing market leaders adopting AI tools. Include employee satisfaction benefits: AI handles mundane tasks, allowing staff to focus on strategic work. Prepare for budget discussions with clear cost-benefit analysis and implementation timeline. Consider bringing in external case studies or arranging demos with AI tool vendors. Frame AI adoption as essential for staying competitive rather than optional innovation.",

  "query_10": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography. Key concepts include: decentralization (no single point of control), immutability (records can't be easily altered), transparency (all transactions are visible), and consensus mechanisms (networks agree on valid transactions). Major blockchain types include public (Bitcoin, Ethereum), private (enterprise solutions), and consortium blockchains. Practical applications span cryptocurrency, smart contracts (self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code), supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, voting systems, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Benefits include reduced intermediaries, increased security, global accessibility, and programmable money. However, limitations include scalability issues (Bitcoin processes 7 transactions/second vs Visa's 65,000), high energy consumption (especially proof-of-work systems), regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Current trends include layer 2 solutions for scalability, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), NFTs for digital ownership, and enterprise adoption for supply chain and document verification. For businesses, consider blockchain when you need: immutable record-keeping, multi-party transactions without trusted intermediaries, or transparent audit trails. The technology is still evolving, with ongoing developments in sustainability, scalability, and regulatory frameworks.",

  "query_11": "To improve team productivity, start by identifying root causes through one-on-ones, anonymous surveys, and workflow analysis. Common issues include unclear priorities, excessive meetings, context switching, inadequate tools, and communication gaps. Implement structured solutions: establish clear goals and success metrics using frameworks like OKRs, implement regular retrospectives to identify and address blockers, optimize meeting culture (no-meeting blocks, agenda requirements, async-first communication), and provide proper tools and training. Focus on removing obstacles: streamline approval processes, reduce bureaucracy, address technical debt that slows development, and eliminate unnecessary reporting. Improve team dynamics through: clear role definitions, regular feedback cycles, recognition programs, and team building activities. Consider workload management: ensure realistic deadlines, prevent burnout through proper resource allocation, encourage breaks and vacation time, and monitor for signs of overwork. Measure progress with metrics like sprint velocity, cycle time, code review turnaround, and team satisfaction scores. Create psychological safety where team members feel comfortable raising concerns and suggesting improvements. Invest in professional development and career growth opportunities. Regular team health checks and adjusting strategies based on what's working will help maintain momentum and continuous improvement.",
