  "query_2": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on OpenAI's official communications and technical publications, 2025 has been transformative for their language model development program. The August release of GPT-5 represents their most advanced system, demonstrating exceptional performance across multiple domains: 74.9% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified coding benchmarks, 94.6% success rate on AIME 2025 mathematical evaluations, and 45% reduction in factual errors compared to GPT-4o baseline measurements. Additional 2025 releases include GPT-4.5 as a research preview showcasing advances in pre-training and post-training methodologies, and the comprehensive GPT-4.1 series comprising standard, mini, and nano variants that consistently outperform GPT-4o across multiple evaluation metrics. Significantly, GPT-5 is accessible to all ChatGPT user categories including free tier users, marking the first democratization of advanced reasoning capabilities to non-paying users in OpenAI's product history. The platform is approaching 700 million weekly active users, with Microsoft implementing comprehensive integration across its product ecosystem, demonstrating continued technological leadership and expanding global accessibility to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formally proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch building on Eric Brewer's conjecture, establishes a fundamental impossibility result constraining distributed data store design: it is mathematically impossible for any distributed system to simultaneously guarantee Consistency (linearizability requiring all nodes to observe identical data states), Availability (every request receives a response without guarantee of most recent data), and Partition tolerance (system continues operating despite arbitrary network failures). This theoretical constraint translates into practical architectural decisions: CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance) systems like MongoDB in strong consistency mode or traditional ACID databases prioritize data correctness and can handle network partitions but may become unavailable during network disruptions - essential for financial systems where data accuracy is non-negotiable. AP (Availability + Partition tolerance) systems such as Amazon DynamoDB or Apache Cassandra emphasize continuous operation and partition resilience while accepting eventual consistency models - appropriate for social media platforms where user experience takes precedence over immediate data synchronization. CA (Consistency + Availability) systems theoretically exist but cannot handle network partitions, making them unsuitable for genuinely distributed environments where partition failures are inevitable. Contemporary distributed architectures often implement different CAP trade-offs per microservice component, employing eventual consistency patterns, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), vector clocks, and sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms to minimize the practical impact of these fundamental constraints.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation demands comprehensive understanding of the protocol's threat model and strict adherence to current security recommendations established by RFC 6749, RFC 6819, and subsequent security best current practices. Consistently employ Authorization Code flow combined with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange, defined in RFC 7636), which is particularly critical for public clients including single-page applications, mobile applications, and any client unable to securely store client credentials. Generate cryptographically strong, unpredictable state parameters using cryptographically secure random number generators to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, implementing rigorous validation of these parameters during authorization server callback processing. Establish strict redirect URI validation using exact string matching against pre-configured allowlists, never employing wildcards, regular expressions, or dynamic URI construction that could introduce open redirect vulnerabilities or authorization code interception attacks. Implement comprehensive token security practices: maintain access tokens exclusively in application memory with minimal lifespans (typically 15-30 minutes), store refresh tokens in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies with appropriate domain and path restrictions to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and unauthorized token access. Deploy thorough server-side token validation for all protected resources and implement granular scope validation strictly adhering to least privilege access principles, ensuring clients receive only the minimum permissions necessary for their intended functionality. Maintain end-to-end HTTPS implementation with current TLS versions (TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 preferred) and implement proper certificate validation including certificate pinning for high-security applications.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] The React versus Vue framework selection for your startup involves evaluating multiple strategic, technical, and organizational factors that will significantly impact both immediate development productivity and long-term project maintainability and scalability. React provides substantial advantages including an extensive, mature ecosystem with thousands of third-party libraries, components, and tools, a significantly larger talent pool of experienced developers facilitating recruitment and enabling competitive hiring, comprehensive mobile development capabilities through React Native enabling code sharing between web and mobile platforms, and demonstrated scalability for complex, enterprise-level applications with established architectural patterns and performance optimization strategies. However, React presents challenges including a steeper initial learning curve requiring understanding of concepts like JSX, component lifecycle, and state management patterns, more complex initial project setup requiring configuration of build tools and development environments, and greater configuration overhead for achieving production-ready applications. Vue offers compelling benefits including gentler developer onboarding with more intuitive templates and progressive adoption capabilities, exceptional documentation quality that accelerates learning and reduces development friction, faster initial project development through opinionated conventions, sensible defaults, and comprehensive CLI tooling, and typically superior out-of-the-box performance for standard web applications due to optimized reactivity system and smaller bundle sizes. Consider your team's current technical expertise and learning capacity, project complexity requirements and anticipated scaling needs, development timeline constraints and market pressures, hiring plans and team expansion projections, and mobile development requirements that might favor React's ecosystem advantages.",
