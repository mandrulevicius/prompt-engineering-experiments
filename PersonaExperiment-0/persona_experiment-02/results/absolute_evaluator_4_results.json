Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: The system remains operational and responsive. Every request receives a response, without guarantee of the most recent data.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues operating despite network failures or communication breakdowns between nodes.\\n\\n**Practical Implications**:\\n\\n*CP Systems* (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Traditional RDBMS with ACID properties, MongoDB with strong consistency. These sacrifice availability during network partitions but ensure data correctness.\\n\\n*AP Systems* (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Cassandra, DynamoDB, eventual consistency systems. These remain available during partitions but may serve stale data.\\n\\n*CA Systems* (Consistency + Availability): Theoretical in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable in real-world deployments.\\n\\n**Engineering Decisions**: The theorem forces architectural choices based on business requirements. Financial systems typically choose CP for correctness, while social media platforms choose AP for user experience. Modern approaches like CRDTs and vector clocks attempt to minimize these trade-offs through clever data structures and conflict resolution strategies.",

Validate state on callback.\\n\\n*Redirect URI Validation*: Implement exact string matching for redirect URIs. Use allowlist approach, never wildcards.\\n\\n*Token Storage*: Store access tokens in memory only. Use httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies for refresh tokens. Implement proper token rotation.\\n\\n*Scope Principle*: Request minimal necessary scopes. Implement scope validation on resource servers.\\n\\n**Implementation Patterns**:\\n\\n*Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)*: Handle OAuth flows server-side, expose session cookies to frontend. Prevents token exposure to browser.\\n\\n*Token Introspection*: Use RFC 7662 for real-time token validation in microservices architectures.\\n\\n*JWT Considerations*: If using JWT tokens, validate signatures, check exp/nbf claims, implement proper key rotation. Consider opaque tokens for better revocation control.\\n\\n**Common Vulnerabilities**: Avoid implicit flow, validate all redirect URIs, implement proper CORS policies, use TLS 1.2+, and regularly audit dependencies for security updates.",
