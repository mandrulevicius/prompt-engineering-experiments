    "Actionability is the biggest differentiator (+0.6 point improvement)",
    "Technical depth appropriate to query type enhances user satisfaction"
  ],
  "production_recommendations": [
    "Implement hardcoded role assignment system",
    "Use three primary roles: Research Librarian, Domain Expert, Practical Advisor",
    "Focus on structured, example-rich responses",
    "Strip role indicators from user-facing responses",
    "Proceed with testing automatic role selection accuracy"
