    "question": "What should I know about blockchain?",
    "response_a": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography. Key concepts include: decentralization (no single point of control), immutability (records can't be easily altered), transparency (all transactions are visible), and consensus mechanisms (networks agree on valid transactions). Major blockchain types include public (Bitcoin, Ethereum), private (enterprise solutions), and consortium blockchains. Practical applications span cryptocurrency, smart contracts (self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code), supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, voting systems, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Benefits include reduced intermediaries, increased security, global accessibility, and programmable money. However, limitations include scalability issues (Bitcoin processes 7 transactions/second vs Visa's 65,000), high energy consumption (especially proof-of-work systems), regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Current trends include layer 2 solutions for scalability, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), NFTs for digital ownership, and enterprise adoption for supply chain and document verification. For businesses, consider blockchain when you need: immutable record-keeping, multi-party transactions without trusted intermediaries, or transparent audit trails. The technology is still evolving, with ongoing developments in sustainability, scalability, and regulatory frameworks.",

Focus on removing obstacles: streamline approval processes, reduce bureaucracy, address technical debt that slows development, and eliminate unnecessary reporting. Improve team dynamics through: clear role definitions, regular feedback cycles, recognition programs, and team building activities. Consider workload management: ensure realistic deadlines, prevent burnout through proper resource allocation, encourage breaks and vacation time, and monitor for signs of overwork. Measure progress with metrics like sprint velocity, cycle time, code review turnaround, and team satisfaction scores. Create psychological safety where team members feel comfortable raising concerns and suggesting improvements. Invest in professional development and career growth opportunities.

    "response_a": "The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practical implications include: For banking systems, you typically choose Consistency + Partition tolerance, accepting temporary unavailability during network issues to ensure data accuracy. Social media platforms often choose Availability + Partition tolerance, allowing eventual consistency where users might temporarily see different data. Traditional SQL databases prioritize Consistency + Availability in single-node scenarios but must sacrifice one when distributed. NoSQL databases like Cassandra (AP) or MongoDB (CP by default) are designed around these trade-offs. Modern approaches use techniques like eventual consistency, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and microservices with different CAP choices per service. Understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about database selection, system design, and acceptable trade-offs based on business requirements.",

Set short expiration times for access tokens (15-60 minutes) and longer for refresh tokens. Validate all tokens on the server side and never trust client-side validation. Use HTTPS everywhere and validate SSL certificates. Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege. Store client secrets securely (never in client-side code) and rotate them regularly. Validate redirect URIs against a whitelist and use exact matching. Implement rate limiting and monitor for suspicious activity. Handle token revocation properly and clear tokens on logout. Use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than rolling your own implementation.

React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market opportunities, and better performance for complex applications. It has strong backing from Meta, extensive third-party libraries, and is preferred for mobile development with React Native. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more boilerplate code. Vue provides gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and faster development for smaller teams. It offers better performance out-of-the-box for most applications and has a more opinionated structure that can speed development. However, it has a smaller ecosystem and fewer experienced developers available. For startups, consider: team expertise (choose what your team knows best), project complexity (React for complex, Vue for simpler), development speed needs (Vue generally faster to start), long-term scaling plans (React has more enterprise adoption), and hiring plans (React developers are more abundant). If you're building a simple to medium complexity app with a small team, Vue might be better. For complex applications or if you plan to scale the team quickly, React might be the safer choice.",
    "response_b": "For a startup frontend, I'd recommend React due to: larger talent pool making hiring easier, extensive ecosystem with mature libraries, better long-term support from Meta, and superior development tools. React's component reusability and performance optimizations suit scaling needs. However, choose Vue if your team prefers simpler syntax, you need faster initial development, or you're building smaller applications. Consider your team's experience, project timeline, and long-term maintenance requirements. React's steeper learning curve pays dividends as your startup grows and needs to onboard developers quickly.",

Document your achievements with specific metrics, successful projects, and impact on business outcomes. Research the company's financial health, recent funding, and typical compensation structure. During negotiation, present your case professionally by leading with your value proposition, not personal financial needs. Negotiate total compensation, including base salary, equity, bonuses, and benefits. Be specific with numbers and justify them with market data and your contributions. Consider non-salary benefits like additional PTO, learning budget, flexible work arrangements, or title changes. Use collaborative language ('How can we make this work?') rather than ultimatums. Be prepared to negotiate multiple rounds - initial offers are rarely final. Have a clear walk-away number but don't reveal it early. If they can't meet your salary requirements, explore other valuable perks. Get final offers in writing before accepting.
