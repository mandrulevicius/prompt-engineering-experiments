    "response": "The CAP theorem states that distributed systems can guarantee only two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means: CP systems (like traditional SQL databases) sacrifice availability during network partitions; AP systems (like NoSQL databases) accept eventual consistency; CA systems don't exist in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern systems use techniques like eventual consistency, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and multi-version concurrency control to work within these constraints.",

React's component reusability and performance optimizations suit scaling needs. However, choose Vue if your team prefers simpler syntax, you need faster initial development, or you're building smaller applications. Consider your team's experience, project timeline, and long-term maintenance requirements. React's steeper learning curve pays dividends as your startup grows and needs to onboard developers quickly.",

Applications extend beyond cryptocurrency to supply chain tracking, smart contracts, digital identity, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, consider limitations: energy consumption, scalability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Blockchain is valuable when you need trustless transactions, audit trails, or removing intermediaries, but traditional databases often suffice for centralized applications.",
