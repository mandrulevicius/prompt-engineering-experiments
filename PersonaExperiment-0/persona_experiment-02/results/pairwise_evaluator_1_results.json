    "response_a": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography. Key concepts include: decentralization (no single point of control), immutability (records can't be easily altered), transparency (all transactions are visible), and consensus mechanisms (networks agree on valid transactions). Major blockchain types include public (Bitcoin, Ethereum), private (enterprise solutions), and consortium blockchains. Practical applications span cryptocurrency, smart contracts (self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code), supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, voting systems, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Benefits include reduced intermediaries, increased security, global accessibility, and programmable money. However, limitations include scalability issues (Bitcoin processes 7 transactions/second vs Visa's 65,000), high energy consumption (especially proof-of-work systems), regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Current trends include layer 2 solutions for scalability, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), NFTs for digital ownership, and enterprise adoption for supply chain and document verification. For businesses, consider blockchain when you need: immutable record-keeping, multi-party transactions without trusted intermediaries, or transparent audit trails. The technology is still evolving, with ongoing developments in sustainability, scalability, and regulatory frameworks.",

Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: The system remains operational and responsive. Every request receives a response, without guarantee of the most recent data.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues operating despite network failures or communication breakdowns between nodes.\\n\\n**Practical Implications**:\\n\\n*CP Systems* (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Traditional RDBMS with ACID properties, MongoDB with strong consistency. These sacrifice availability during network partitions but ensure data correctness.\\n\\n*AP Systems* (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Cassandra, DynamoDB, eventual consistency systems. These remain available during partitions but may serve stale data.\\n\\n*CA Systems* (Consistency + Availability): Theoretical in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable in real-world deployments.\\n\\n**Engineering Decisions**: The theorem forces architectural choices based on business requirements. Financial systems typically choose CP for correctness, while social media platforms choose AP for user experience. Modern approaches like CRDTs and vector clocks attempt to minimize these trade-offs through clever data structures and conflict resolution strategies.",
    "response_b": "The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practical implications include: For banking systems, you typically choose Consistency + Partition tolerance, accepting temporary unavailability during network issues to ensure data accuracy. Social media platforms often choose Availability + Partition tolerance, allowing eventual consistency where users might temporarily see different data. Traditional SQL databases prioritize Consistency + Availability in single-node scenarios but must sacrifice one when distributed. NoSQL databases like Cassandra (AP) or MongoDB (CP by default) are designed around these trade-offs. Modern approaches use techniques like eventual consistency, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and microservices with different CAP choices per service. Understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about database selection, system design, and acceptable trade-offs based on business requirements.",

Set short expiration times for access tokens (15-60 minutes) and longer for refresh tokens. Validate all tokens on the server side and never trust client-side validation. Use HTTPS everywhere and validate SSL certificates. Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege. Store client secrets securely (never in client-side code) and rotate them regularly. Validate redirect URIs against a whitelist and use exact matching.

React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market opportunities, and better performance for complex applications. It has strong backing from Meta, extensive third-party libraries, and is preferred for mobile development with React Native. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more boilerplate code. Vue provides gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and faster development for smaller teams. It offers better performance out-of-the-box for most applications and has a more opinionated structure that can speed development. However, it has a smaller ecosystem and fewer experienced developers available. For startups, consider: team expertise (choose what your team knows best), project complexity (React for complex, Vue for simpler), development speed needs (Vue generally faster to start), long-term scaling plans (React has more enterprise adoption), and hiring plans (React developers are more abundant). If you're building a simple to medium complexity app with a small team, Vue might be better. For complex applications or if you plan to scale the team quickly, React might be the safer choice.",

    "response_a": "Starting machine learning as a complete beginner, follow this structured path: Begin with foundations by learning Python programming (focus on NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries) and basic statistics/probability. Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera or the fast.ai Practical Deep Learning course. Start with supervised learning concepts like linear regression, decision trees, and classification. Use hands-on tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab (free GPU access), and datasets from Kaggle. Practice with beginner-friendly projects: predicting house prices, image classification with pre-trained models, or analyzing datasets you're interested in. Learn key libraries: Scikit-learn for traditional ML, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning. Focus on understanding when to use different algorithms rather than memorizing formulas. Join communities like Kaggle, Reddit's r/MachineLearning, or local ML meetups. Work on portfolio projects that demonstrate your skills with real data and clear explanations. Consider specializing based on interest: computer vision, natural language processing, or recommendation systems. Remember that ML is iterative - start simple, get results, then add complexity. The key is consistent practice with real projects rather than just theoretical study.",

    "response_a": "To debug Node.js performance issues systematically: First, identify the bottleneck using profiling tools like Node.js built-in profiler (--prof flag), clinic.js for comprehensive analysis, or New Relic/DataDog for production monitoring. Check common issues: memory leaks (use --inspect and Chrome DevTools heap profiler), blocking the event loop (use --trace-warnings), inefficient database queries (add query logging), and unoptimized algorithms. Use performance measurement tools like console.time(), process.hrtime.bigint(), or the perf_hooks module. Monitor key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, event loop lag, and response times. Common solutions include: implementing connection pooling for databases, adding caching layers (Redis), optimizing database queries with indexes, using streaming for large data processing, implementing pagination for large datasets, and clustering for CPU-intensive tasks. Check for: synchronous operations in async code, missing await keywords, inefficient JSON parsing, large object iterations, and memory-intensive operations. Use tools like autocannon for load testing and 0x for flame graphs. Consider upgrading Node.js version, optimizing Docker containers if used, and implementing proper error handling to prevent cascading failures. Profile both development and production environments as they often behave differently.",
