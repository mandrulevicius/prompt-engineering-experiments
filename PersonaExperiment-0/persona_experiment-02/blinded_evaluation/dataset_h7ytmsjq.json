Nearly 700 million people now use ChatGPT weekly.",
  "query_3": "The CAP theorem states that distributed systems can only guarantee two of three properties: **Consistency** (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), **Availability** (system remains operational), and **Partition tolerance** (system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means: CP systems (like traditional RDBMS with ACID) sacrifice availability during network partitions; AP systems (like Cassandra, DynamoDB) sacrifice strong consistency for availability; CA systems don't truly exist in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern systems often use 'eventual consistency' models, BASE principles, and techniques like vector clocks, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos) to manage these trade-offs intelligently.",
  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires: **Use PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for all clients, especially SPAs and mobile apps; **Implement proper state parameters** to prevent CSRF attacks; **Use short-lived access tokens** (15-60 minutes) with refresh tokens stored securely; **Validate redirect URIs** strictly and use HTTPS everywhere; **Implement proper scope validation** and principle of least privilege; **Store client secrets securely** (never in frontend code); **Use secure token storage** (httpOnly cookies for web, keychain/keystore for mobile); **Implement rate limiting** and monitor for suspicious activities; **Validate JWT signatures** and claims properly; **Use authorization servers** like Auth0, Okta, or AWS Cognito rather than building from scratch. Always follow RFC 6749 and security best practices from RFC 6819.",
  "query_5": "For startups, I'd recommend **React** in most cases due to: larger talent pool (easier hiring), extensive ecosystem, better enterprise adoption (future-proofing), and superior tooling. React's learning curve is manageable, has excellent TypeScript support, and frameworks like Next.js provide full-stack capabilities. **Choose Vue if**: your team values simplicity over ecosystem size, you're building smaller-scale applications, or you prefer Vue's template syntax and gentler learning curve. Vue 3 with Composition API is excellent, but the ecosystem and job market are smaller. Key factors: React for VC-backed startups needing rapid scaling and easy talent acquisition; Vue for bootstrapped startups prioritizing developer happiness and faster initial development. Both are solid choices, but React's ecosystem advantages usually outweigh Vue's simplicity benefits for growing startups.",
  "query_6": "Structure salary negotiations strategically: **Research thoroughly** - use levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and network contacts for market data in your specific location and tech stack. **Document your value** - quantify impact with metrics (performance improvements, cost savings, team growth). **Time it right** - during performance reviews, after major wins, or at offer stage. **Present total compensation** - base salary, equity, bonuses, benefits, learning budget. **Practice your pitch** - 'Based on my research and contributions, market rate for my role is X-Y range. Given my impact on [specific projects], I'd like to discuss adjusting my compensation to $X.' **Have alternatives** - other offers or concrete opportunities strengthen your position. **Be collaborative** - frame as wanting to stay and grow. **Consider non-salary benefits** - flexible work, additional equity, professional development budget, title changes. **Get everything in writing** and don't accept first offer - there's usually room for negotiation.",
  "query_7": "Start your ML journey with this structured path: **Phase 1 (2-3 months)** - Learn Python fundamentals, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (Coursera) for solid theoretical foundation. **Phase 2 (2-3 months)** - Hands-on with scikit-learn: regression, classification, clustering.

  "query_8": "Let's systematically debug your Node.js performance issues: **Step 1: Profiling** - Use `node --prof` or clinic.js to identify CPU hotspots and memory leaks. **Step 2: Memory Analysis** - Check for memory leaks with `process.memoryUsage()`, heap snapshots in Chrome DevTools, or tools like clinic.js bubbleprof. **Step 3: Event Loop Monitoring** - Use `clinic.js doctor` to detect event loop blocking. **Common Issues**: Synchronous operations blocking the event loop, inefficient database queries, missing connection pooling, memory leaks from unclosed resources, inefficient algorithms in hot code paths. **Quick Wins**: Enable compression, use clustering, implement caching (Redis), optimize database queries with indexes, use streaming for large data processing. **Tools**: clinic.js, 0x for flame graphs, autocannon for load testing. Share your specific symptoms (high CPU, memory usage, slow responses) and I can provide targeted debugging steps.",
  "query_9": "Build a compelling business case for AI adoption: **Frame around business impact** - Don't lead with technology, focus on competitive advantage, cost reduction, and revenue growth. **Present concrete ROI** - developer productivity gains (30-50% faster coding with AI tools), customer service efficiency (chatbots handling 60-80% of queries), data analysis acceleration. **Address concerns proactively** - data security (emphasize on-premise/private cloud options), job displacement (frame as augmentation, not replacement), costs (show productivity gains offsetting expenses). **Start small and scale** - pilot projects with measurable outcomes, showcase quick wins, then expand. **Competitive positioning** - show what competitors are doing, emphasize the risk of falling behind. **Provide specific tools and budgets** - GitHub Copilot for developers, ChatGPT Teams for knowledge work, specific vendor solutions for your industry. Make it about business transformation, not just cool technology.",
  "query_10": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology creating tamper-evident records across multiple computers. **Core concepts**: Decentralization (no single authority), immutability (records can't be changed), transparency (transactions are visible), and consensus mechanisms (agreement on valid transactions). **Key applications**: Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum), smart contracts (automated agreements), supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi). **Types**: Public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum), private blockchains (enterprise use), and hybrid solutions. **Practical implications**: High energy consumption, scalability challenges, regulatory uncertainty, but potential for reducing intermediaries and increasing trust in digital transactions. **Current state**: Moving beyond hype toward practical enterprise applications in finance, logistics, and healthcare. Consider blockchain when you need: multiple parties to share data without trust, audit trails, or programmable agreements. Skip it for simple database needs or when centralized solutions work fine.",
  "query_11": "Address team productivity systematically: **Identify root causes** - Are issues technical (legacy code, unclear requirements) or process-related (too many meetings, unclear priorities)? **Measure current state** - Track velocity, cycle time, deployment frequency, and team satisfaction through surveys. **Common productivity killers**: Context switching, unclear requirements, technical debt, poor tooling, excessive meetings. **Solutions**: Implement focused work blocks, establish clear definition of done, allocate time for technical debt reduction, streamline deployment processes, and reduce meeting overhead. **Communication improvements**: Daily standups focused on blockers, async updates, clear documentation, and regular retrospectives. **Technical improvements**: Automation of repetitive tasks, better development tools, CI/CD optimization. **Team dynamics**: Pair programming for knowledge sharing, code reviews for quality, and psychological safety for innovation. Start with the biggest pain point, measure improvements, and iterate. What specific productivity challenges is your team facing?",
