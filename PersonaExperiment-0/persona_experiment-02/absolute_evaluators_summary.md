# Absolute Evaluators Summary

## Overview
Created 3 absolute evaluators to independently score responses from different test conditions using a 1-5 scale without comparisons.

## Evaluators Created

### Evaluator 4: Test 1 (Hardcoded) Responses
- **Dataset**: `dataset_r5ly4mxl.json` (blinded filename)
- **Condition**: Test 1 (Hardcoded roles)
- **Output**: `results/absolute_evaluator_4_results.json`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Evaluator 5: Test 2 (Predefined) Responses  
- **Dataset**: `dataset_gj5nnf5m.json` (blinded filename)
- **Condition**: Test 2 (Predefined role selection)
- **Output**: `results/absolute_evaluator_5_results.json`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Evaluator 6: Test 4 (Dynamic+Tone) Responses
- **Dataset**: `dataset_f92q4icc.json` (blinded filename)
- **Condition**: Test 4 (Dynamic role + tone consistency)
- **Output**: `results/absolute_evaluator_6_results.json`  
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Evaluation Criteria
Each response was evaluated on 5 criteria using a 1-5 scale:

1. **Helpfulness** (1-5): How well does it address the user's actual need?
2. **Appropriateness** (1-5): How well-suited is the response style/approach to this query type?
3. **Completeness** (1-5): Does it provide sufficient information/guidance?
4. **Actionability** (1-5): How easy is it for the user to act on this response?
5. **Overall Quality** (1-5): How would you rate this response overall?

## Data Processing
- **Role Stripping**: All `[Role: X]` indicators were stripped from responses before evaluation
- **Blind Evaluation**: Evaluators only saw randomized dataset names, not condition labels
- **Independent Scoring**: Each response scored independently without comparisons to other conditions

## Result Format
Each result file contains evaluations for all 12 queries in this format:
```json
{
  "query_1": {
    "question": "...",
    "response": "...",
    "evaluation": {
      "helpfulness": 4,
      "helpfulness_reasoning": "...",
      "appropriateness": 5,
      "appropriateness_reasoning": "...",
      "completeness": 3,
      "completeness_reasoning": "...",
      "actionability": 4,
      "actionability_reasoning": "...",
      "overall": 4,
      "overall_reasoning": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Generated
- `create_absolute_evaluator_4.py` - Evaluator script for Test 1
- `create_absolute_evaluator_5.py` - Evaluator script for Test 2  
- `create_absolute_evaluator_6.py` - Evaluator script for Test 4
- `results/absolute_evaluator_4_results.json` - Test 1 evaluation results
- `results/absolute_evaluator_5_results.json` - Test 2 evaluation results
- `results/absolute_evaluator_6_results.json` - Test 4 evaluation results

## Quality Controls
- ✅ All datasets contained expected 12 queries
- ✅ Role indicators properly stripped from responses
- ✅ Evaluation format consistent across all evaluators
- ✅ Results saved to correct directory structure
- ✅ Blinded evaluation maintained (no condition labels visible to evaluators)

## Next Steps
The absolute evaluation results are now ready for:
1. Statistical analysis comparing conditions
2. Aggregation with pairwise evaluation results  
3. Final experiment analysis and reporting
