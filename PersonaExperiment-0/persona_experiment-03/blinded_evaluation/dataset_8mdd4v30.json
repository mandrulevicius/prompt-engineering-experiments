  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, established by computer scientist Eric Brewer, reveals a fundamental limitation in distributed computing where systems can simultaneously provide only two of three critical properties: Consistency (ensuring all nodes maintain identical data states), Availability (guaranteeing system responsiveness to requests), and Partition tolerance (continuing operation despite network communication failures). This constraint necessitates architectural trade-offs based on application requirements and business priorities. CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance) systems like traditional ACID-compliant relational databases prioritize data accuracy and can handle network partitions but may become temporarily unavailable during network disruptions. AP (Availability + Partition tolerance) systems such as Cassandra, DynamoDB, or MongoDB in certain configurations maintain service availability during network issues but may temporarily serve stale or inconsistent data until synchronization occurs. Modern distributed systems often implement sophisticated approaches including eventual consistency models, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), vector clocks, and consensus algorithms like Raft or Byzantine Fault Tolerance to minimize the practical impact of CAP theorem limitations while meeting specific business and technical requirements.",
