  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem defines fundamental limitations in distributed system design, proving that systems can guarantee only two of three properties simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes provide identical data), Availability (system responsiveness), and Partition tolerance (operation during network failures). This constraint creates architectural decisions: CP systems (traditional RDBMS, MongoDB with strong consistency) prioritize data correctness but may become unavailable during network issues; AP systems (Cassandra, DynamoDB) maintain responsiveness but may serve eventually consistent data; CA systems cannot exist in truly distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern approaches use eventual consistency models, conflict-free replicated data types, and sophisticated consensus algorithms to optimize within these constraints.",

Implement secure token storage: memory-only for access tokens, httpOnly secure cookies for refresh tokens with proper rotation. Employ short token lifespans (15-30 minutes) with robust refresh mechanisms. Validate all JWT claims (exp, nbf, aud, iss) with proper signature verification and key rotation. Deploy TLS 1.3+, rate limiting, comprehensive audit logging, and consider Backend-for-Frontend patterns to minimize browser token exposure.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Choose your startup's frontend framework strategically: React provides the largest developer talent pool, extensive ecosystem with mature libraries, React Native integration for mobile development, and strong Meta backing ensuring long-term viability. It excels for complex applications requiring sophisticated state management and scales well for enterprise use. Vue offers gentler learning curves for teams, excellent documentation, faster initial development cycles, and better integration with legacy systems. Consider your specific context: team experience level, project complexity, hiring strategy, and timeline constraints. React developers command higher salaries but are more abundant; Vue developers may be cost-effective but harder to recruit. Prototype key features in both frameworks to evaluate team productivity and technical fit.",
