  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem represents a fundamental theoretical constraint in distributed computing, establishing that distributed data stores cannot simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:\\n\\n**Consistency (C)**: Strong consistency ensures all nodes in the system reflect identical data at any given point in time. Every read operation returns the most recent write or fails with an error.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: The system remains operational and responsive to requests. Every non-failing node returns a response within a reasonable time frame, regardless of whether it contains the most recent data.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues functioning despite arbitrary network failures or communication breakdowns between nodes.\\n\\n**Architectural Implications:**\\n\\n**CP Systems**: Prioritize data consistency and partition tolerance, sacrificing availability during network splits. Examples include traditional ACID-compliant databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL in synchronous replication mode), MongoDB with strong read preferences, and HBase. These systems are suitable for applications requiring absolute data correctness, such as financial transactions or inventory management.\\n\\n**AP Systems**: Maintain availability and partition tolerance while accepting eventual consistency. Examples include Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak, and CouchDB. These systems excel in scenarios where temporary inconsistency is acceptable, such as social media feeds, content delivery networks, or user activity tracking.\\n\\n**Modern Mitigation Strategies**: Contemporary distributed systems employ sophisticated techniques to minimize CAP theorem impact, including conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for mathematically provable eventual consistency, vector clocks for causality tracking, and consensus algorithms like Raft or PBFT for maintaining consistency in specific system components while allowing availability in others.",
