  "query_3": "The CAP theorem states that distributed systems can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see identical data), Availability (system remains responsive), and Partition tolerance (continues operating despite network failures). This creates fundamental trade-offs in system design. CP systems like traditional databases prioritize data consistency and can handle network partitions but may become unavailable. AP systems like Cassandra maintain availability during partitions but may serve stale data. Modern systems often use techniques like eventual consistency, where data becomes consistent over time, or implement different guarantees for different operations. Understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about database selection and system design based on business requirements and acceptable trade-offs.",

  "query_4": "Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires following several best practices. Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for all clients, especially public ones. Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. Store tokens securely - use httpOnly cookies for web apps and secure storage for mobile. Implement short token lifespans with proper refresh mechanisms. Validate all redirect URIs against a strict allowlist using exact matching. Use HTTPS everywhere and validate SSL certificates. Implement proper scope validation following the principle of least privilege. Never store client secrets in client-side code. Use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than custom implementations. Regularly audit your setup and keep all dependencies updated. Consider implementing rate limiting and monitoring for suspicious activities.",

  "query_5": "The choice between React and Vue depends on your specific situation. React offers a larger ecosystem, more job opportunities, and better performance for complex applications. It has strong corporate backing from Meta and extensive third-party libraries. However, React has a steeper learning curve and requires more setup. Vue provides a gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and faster development for smaller teams. It offers good performance out-of-the-box and more opinionated structure that can accelerate development. Consider your team's experience level, project complexity, hiring needs, and long-term scaling plans. If you have experienced developers and complex requirements, React might be better. For smaller teams or simpler projects where development speed is crucial, Vue could be the right choice. Both are excellent frameworks that can scale effectively.",
