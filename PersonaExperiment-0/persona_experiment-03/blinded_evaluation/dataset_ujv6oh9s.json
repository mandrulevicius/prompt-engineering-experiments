  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem establishes fundamental constraints in distributed computing, proving systems can guarantee only two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes return identical data simultaneously), Availability (system remains responsive to requests), and Partition tolerance (operation continues despite network communication failures). This creates unavoidable architectural trade-offs: CP systems like traditional RDBMS prioritize data correctness but may become unavailable during network partitions; AP systems like Cassandra maintain responsiveness but may serve eventually consistent data; CA systems cannot exist in truly distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern distributed systems employ sophisticated techniques like vector clocks, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and tunable consistency models to optimize within these fundamental constraints.",
