  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, demonstrates that distributed systems face an inherent limitation where only two of three desirable properties can be simultaneously guaranteed: Consistency (ensuring all nodes reflect identical data), Availability (maintaining system responsiveness), and Partition tolerance (operating despite network communication failures). This fundamental constraint forces architectural decisions based on business priorities. Systems emphasizing Consistency and Partition tolerance (CP systems) like traditional relational databases may sacrifice availability during network disruptions but maintain data integrity. Systems prioritizing Availability and Partition tolerance (AP systems) like Cassandra or DynamoDB remain accessible during network issues but may temporarily serve inconsistent data. Modern approaches often employ eventual consistency models, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and sophisticated consensus algorithms to minimize the practical impact of these trade-offs while meeting specific application requirements.",
