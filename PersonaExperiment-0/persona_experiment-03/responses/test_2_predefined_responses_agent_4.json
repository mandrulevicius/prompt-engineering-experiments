ChatGPT's user base approaches 700 million weekly users, representing nearly 10% of global population. Microsoft has integrated GPT-5 across its ecosystem, enhancing enterprise capabilities through Microsoft 365 Copilot.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem establishes that distributed systems can simultaneously guarantee only two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes return identical data), Availability (system remains responsive), and Partition tolerance (operation continues despite network failures). This creates fundamental architectural trade-offs: CP systems like traditional RDBMS prioritize correctness but may become unavailable during partitions; AP systems like Cassandra maintain responsiveness but may serve stale data; CA systems cannot exist in truly distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern solutions employ eventual consistency, vector clocks, and CRDTs to work within these constraints while optimizing for specific business requirements.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires comprehensive security measures: Use Authorization Code flow with PKCE for all clients, especially public ones. Implement cryptographically random state parameters for CSRF protection and strict redirect URI validation using exact matching. Store tokens securely - httpOnly cookies for web applications, secure storage for mobile. Employ short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) with proper refresh mechanisms. Validate all JWT claims (exp, nbf, aud) and implement signature verification with proper key rotation. Use TLS 1.2+ everywhere, implement rate limiting, and maintain comprehensive audit logs. Consider Backend-for-Frontend patterns to minimize token exposure.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For startup frontend selection, consider these factors: React offers the largest talent pool for hiring, extensive third-party ecosystem, and React Native integration for mobile development. It's ideal for complex applications requiring sophisticated state management. Vue provides a gentler learning curve, faster initial development, and excellent documentation, making it suitable for smaller teams or rapid prototyping. Consider your team's experience level, project complexity, and hiring strategy. React commands higher salaries but offers more job market opportunities. Vue developers may be more cost-effective but harder to source. Build prototypes in both frameworks over 2-3 days to evaluate team productivity and project alignment.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Structure salary negotiations systematically: Research market rates using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and industry reports specific to your role and location. Document achievements with quantifiable metrics showing business impact. Time negotiations strategically around performance reviews or project completions. Present total compensation requests as ranges, considering base salary, equity, bonuses, and benefits. Prepare compelling value propositions highlighting unique contributions and future potential. Address potential objections proactively and explore non-monetary benefits if budget constraints exist. Practice your presentation beforehand, maintain professionalism throughout, and be prepared to negotiate multiple rounds while having a clear walk-away threshold.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Socratic Guide] What specifically draws you to machine learning - solving business problems, understanding how Netflix recommends movies, or building intelligent systems? Understanding your motivation will shape our learning approach. Let's assess your current foundation: Do you have programming experience, particularly with Python? How comfortable are you with statistics and mathematics? Based on your background, we can design a personalized path. Would you prefer starting with theoretical concepts or hands-on projects? Some learners thrive with Andrew Ng's structured course approach, while others prefer Kaggle's practical competitions. What learning style has worked best for you in the past? This will help us create an effective progression through supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Domain Expert] Node.js performance debugging requires systematic profiling and analysis. Use clinic.js suite for comprehensive diagnostics: clinic doctor for overall health assessment, clinic bubbleprof for async operation analysis, and clinic flame for CPU profiling. Implement memory monitoring with heap snapshots and process.memoryUsage() tracking. Check for event loop blocking using performance hooks and tools like 0x for flame graph generation. Common bottlenecks include: blocking synchronous operations, memory leaks from unclosed connections, inefficient database queries, and suboptimal algorithm implementations. Optimize with connection pooling, caching strategies, streaming for large data sets, and proper async/await patterns. Deploy APM tools like New Relic for production monitoring.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Creative Collaborator] Create a compelling AI adoption narrative for your CEO by reframing the conversation around competitive advantage and business transformation. Develop a presentation showcasing three concrete scenarios: customer support automation reducing response times by 60% while improving satisfaction scores, document processing acceleration saving 15 hours weekly per employee, and predictive analytics enabling proactive decision-making. Include competitive intelligence showing how market leaders leverage AI for operational efficiency. Address common concerns about job displacement by positioning AI as workforce augmentation, enabling employees to focus on strategic, creative work. Propose a 90-day pilot program with clear ROI metrics and success criteria to demonstrate value with minimal risk.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Research Librarian] Blockchain technology in 2025 shows significant evolution from cryptocurrency speculation to enterprise infrastructure. The global blockchain market is projected to reach $337 billion by 2031, with 54.7% CAGR driven by practical applications. Key developments include: enterprise supply chain implementation (Walmart, Maersk for product traceability), healthcare record management with $106.1 billion projected market by 2032, Central Bank Digital Currencies with 15+ central banks planning launches by 2030, and energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake adoption reducing consumption by 99.95%.

  "query_11": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Address team productivity systematically by first diagnosing root causes through anonymous surveys and individual conversations. Common issues include unclear priorities, excessive meetings, context switching, and inadequate tools. Implement solutions methodically: establish meeting-free time blocks for focused work, use priority frameworks like OKRs for clarity, optimize communication channels to reduce interruptions, and invest in proper tooling. Create measurable improvements through weekly velocity tracking, cycle time monitoring, and team satisfaction surveys. Involve the team in solution development to build ownership. Address technical debt systematically, allocate 20% time for process improvements, and maintain regular retrospectives to identify what's working and what needs adjustment.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Domain Expert] Python is a high-level, dynamically typed language emphasizing code readability and developer productivity. Key architectural features include bytecode compilation via CPython interpreter, automatic memory management through reference counting and garbage collection, and the Global Interpreter Lock affecting multithreading performance. Python's ecosystem excellence spans scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy), data analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib), machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn), web development (Django, Flask, FastAPI), and automation. Modern Python (3.9+) includes type hints for better tooling, pattern matching for cleaner code, and performance improvements. The language supports multiple paradigms and maintains backward compatibility while continuously evolving through PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) processes."
