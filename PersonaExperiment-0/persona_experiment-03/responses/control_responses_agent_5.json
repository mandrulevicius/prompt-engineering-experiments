  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, establishes that distributed computing systems can only simultaneously provide two of three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues functioning despite network failures). This creates inevitable trade-offs in distributed system design. Systems choosing Consistency and Partition tolerance (CP) may become unavailable during network issues but ensure data accuracy - typical of traditional ACID-compliant databases. Systems prioritizing Availability and Partition tolerance (AP) remain accessible during network problems but may serve outdated information - common in NoSQL databases like Cassandra. Modern distributed systems often implement eventual consistency models and use techniques like conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to minimize the impact of these trade-offs while meeting specific business requirements.",
