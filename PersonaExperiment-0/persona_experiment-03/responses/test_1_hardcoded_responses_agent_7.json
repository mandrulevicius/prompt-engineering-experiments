  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem establishes fundamental constraints in distributed system design, proving that systems can simultaneously guarantee only two of three critical properties:\n\n**Consistency (C)**: All nodes provide identical data at any given moment. Read operations return the most recent write or error.\n\n**Availability (A)**: System maintains responsiveness to all requests, though data currency isn't guaranteed.\n\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: System continues functioning despite network communication failures between nodes.\n\n**Architectural Implications:**\n\n**CP Systems** (Banks, Financial Services): Prioritize data correctness over availability. Examples include traditional RDBMS with ACID transactions, MongoDB with strong consistency settings. During network partitions, these systems may become unavailable but maintain data integrity.\n\n**AP Systems** (Social Media, Content Delivery): Emphasize user experience and uptime. Cassandra, DynamoDB, and eventually consistent systems fall here. They remain responsive during partitions but may serve stale data.\n\n**Engineering Trade-offs**: Real-world systems often implement hybrid approaches using techniques like read/write quorums, vector clocks, and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). Modern architectures may apply different consistency levels to different data types within the same system - strong consistency for financial transactions, eventual consistency for user preferences.\n\n**Strategic Decision Framework**: Choose CP for correctness-critical applications, AP for user-experience-focused systems, and consider domain-specific hybrid approaches for complex enterprise applications.",
