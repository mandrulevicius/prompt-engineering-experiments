  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer in 2000, establishes a fundamental constraint in distributed computing systems. It states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees simultaneously:\\n\\n**Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data at the same time. Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system.\\n\\n**Practical Implications:**\\n\\n**CP Systems** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Traditional RDBMS, MongoDB with strong consistency. These sacrifice availability during network partitions but ensure data correctness. Suitable for financial systems where accuracy is critical.\\n\\n**AP Systems** (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB. These remain available during partitions but may serve stale data. Ideal for social media, content delivery, or systems where eventual consistency is acceptable.\\n\\n**CA Systems** (Consistency + Availability): Theoretically possible but impractical in distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable.\\n\\n**Modern Approaches**: CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), vector clocks, and sophisticated consensus algorithms like Raft attempt to minimize trade-offs. Microservices architectures often implement different CAP choices per service based on specific requirements.",
