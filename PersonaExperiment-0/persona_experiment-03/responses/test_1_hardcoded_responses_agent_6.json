  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer and proven by Gilbert and Lynch, establishes a fundamental impossibility result in distributed computing theory. It demonstrates that distributed systems cannot simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties:\\n\\n**Consistency (C)**: Strong consistency requires that all nodes in a distributed system reflect identical data states at any given moment. Every read operation must return the most recent write result or fail with an explicit error condition.\\n\\n**Availability (A)**: System availability ensures that every request to a non-failing node receives a response within finite time, regardless of whether that response contains the most current data version.\\n\\n**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system must continue operating correctly despite arbitrary message loss or communication failures between network nodes.\\n\\n**Theoretical Implications and System Classifications:**\\n\\n**CP Systems** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Traditional ACID-compliant relational databases, MongoDB with strong consistency settings, HBase, and Redis Cluster. These systems prioritize data correctness and can handle network partitions but sacrifice availability during communication failures. Optimal for applications requiring absolute data integrity such as financial transactions, inventory management, or critical system state maintenance.\\n\\n**AP Systems** (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, CouchDB, Riak, and eventual consistency NoSQL databases. These maintain service availability during network partitions but temporarily accept stale or inconsistent data until synchronization occurs. Suitable for applications where temporary inconsistency is acceptable: social media platforms, content delivery networks, user activity tracking, or collaborative systems.\\n\\n**CA Systems** (Consistency + Availability): Theoretically possible but practically impossible in truly distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable in real-world deployments.\\n\\n**Advanced Mitigation Strategies:**\\nModern distributed systems employ sophisticated techniques to minimize CAP theorem constraints including Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) providing mathematically guaranteed eventual consistency, vector clocks for causal relationship tracking, consensus algorithms like Raft or Byzantine Fault Tolerance for maintaining consistency in critical system components, and hybrid architectures implementing different CAP trade-offs for different data types or system operations within the same application.",
