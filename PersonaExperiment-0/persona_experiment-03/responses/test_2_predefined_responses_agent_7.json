  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem establishes inviolable constraints in distributed system architecture, mathematically proving that systems can simultaneously guarantee only two of three fundamental properties: Consistency (all nodes provide identical data responses), Availability (system maintains responsiveness to all requests), and Partition tolerance (operation continues despite network communication disruptions). These constraints necessitate architectural design decisions: CP systems like traditional relational databases prioritize data integrity but may sacrifice availability during network partitions; AP systems like Cassandra maintain operational responsiveness but accept eventual consistency models; CA systems cannot exist in genuinely distributed environments since network partitions represent inevitable real-world conditions. Contemporary distributed architectures employ sophisticated mechanisms including vector clocks for causality tracking, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for convergent consistency, and tunable consistency models enabling application-specific optimization within these fundamental theoretical boundaries.",
