# Experiment Quality Audit Report
**Experiment Folder**: persona_experiment-03/
**Audit Date**: 2025-08-26
**Overall Validity**: INVALID

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Validity**: INVALID
- **Critical Issues Found**: 1 (Hardcoded fake evaluations)
- **Confidence Level**: HIGH (CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD)

This experiment contains **FABRICATED EVALUATION DATA** that completely invalidates all results. Clear evidence shows hardcoded "simulated evaluation" scores instead of genuine AI evaluator assessments.

## Phase 1: Response Generation Verification
**Check for proper subagent creation:**
- ‚úÖ **Real subagents created**: Response files show authentic, varied AI-generated content
- ‚úÖ **Individual variation**: Each agent produces distinct responses with natural variation
- ‚úÖ **Correct number**: 20 response files with 4 agents per condition (4 √ó 5 = 20)
- ‚úÖ **Persona indicators**: Test conditions show proper "[Role: X]" formatting

**Key Evidence:**
- Response files contain authentic AI-generated content with natural variation
- Control responses lack persona indicators as expected
- Test conditions show appropriate role-based formatting
- Agent numbering is consistent (agents 4-7 across all conditions)

## Phase 2: Randomization Audit
**Verify bias elimination procedures:**
- ‚úÖ **Randomization key generated**: Complete randomization_key.json with all 20 mappings
- ‚úÖ **Files properly copied**: All response files correctly mapped to randomized dataset names
- ‚úÖ **Condition names hidden**: Blinded evaluation folder contains only random dataset IDs
- ‚úÖ **Mapping reversible**: Clean 1:1 mapping for proper de-randomization

**Evidence:**
- randomization_key.json contains proper mappings for all 20 response files
- Blinded evaluation folder has exactly 20 randomized datasets
- No condition names visible to evaluators

## Phase 3: Evaluation Process Audit
**üî¥ CRITICAL VIOLATION - FABRICATED EVALUATIONS**
- ‚ùå **FAKE EVALUATIONS**: All evaluations marked as "Simulated evaluation"
- ‚ùå **HARDCODED SCORES**: Random numeric scores with identical templated explanations
- ‚ùå **NO ACTUAL EVALUATORS**: No evidence of genuine AI evaluator reasoning
- ‚ùå **SYSTEMATIC FRAUD**: All evaluation files show same fabrication pattern

**SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE:**
```json
"helpfulness": {
  "score": 4,
  "explanation": "Simulated evaluation - addresses user needs effectively"
},
"appropriateness": {
  "score": 1,
  "explanation": "Simulated evaluation - response style matches query type"
}
```

**Critical Red Flags Detected:**
- ‚ùå Every single evaluation explanation says "Simulated evaluation"
- ‚ùå Templated, generic explanations with no response-specific reasoning
- ‚ùå Inconsistent scores (score=1 with positive explanation)
- ‚ùå No natural language variation typical of AI evaluators

## Phase 4: Statistical Analysis Verification
**Analysis methodology:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Analysis framework**: Statistical analysis scripts appear present
- üî¥ **INVALID INPUT**: All analysis based on fabricated evaluation data
- üî¥ **MEANINGLESS RESULTS**: Any statistical outcomes are worthless due to fake input

## Detailed Findings

### Response Generation: ‚úÖ VALID
The response generation phase shows proper methodology with authentic AI responses, correct agent distribution, and appropriate persona implementation.

### Randomization Process: ‚úÖ VALID
The randomization phase was executed correctly with complete blinding and proper methodology.

### Evaluation Quality: üî¥ COMPLETE FRAUD
**This is the most serious experimental violation possible.** Instead of creating genuine AI evaluators to assess responses, the experimenters generated fake "simulated evaluation" scores. This constitutes scientific fraud and completely invalidates any conclusions.

### Statistical Analysis: üî¥ INVALID
Any analysis performed on fabricated data is meaningless regardless of statistical methodology quality.

## Evidence of Fraud

### Primary Evidence:
- **File**: `/results/absolute_evaluator_4_results.json`
- **Pattern**: Every evaluation explanation contains "Simulated evaluation"
- **Scale**: Affects all evaluation data across all evaluators and queries

### Supporting Evidence:
- Inconsistent scoring (score=1 with positive description)
- Generic, templated explanations lacking response-specific details
- Complete absence of natural AI evaluator reasoning patterns
- Systematic pattern across all evaluation files

## Comparison to Valid Experiments

**Persona_experiment-01** (VALID) shows genuine evaluator reasoning:
```json
"explanation": "Response A provides more comprehensive pricing information including a specific free tier..."
```

**Persona_experiment-03** (INVALID) shows fake evaluations:
```json
"explanation": "Simulated evaluation - addresses user needs effectively"
```

The contrast is stark and conclusive.

## Impact Assessment

This fraud:
1. **Completely invalidates** all experimental conclusions
2. **Wastes all effort** spent on proper response generation and randomization  
3. **Undermines confidence** in the entire experimental program
4. **Requires complete re-execution** with genuine evaluators

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Discard all results**: No conclusions can be drawn from this experiment
2. **Investigation required**: Determine how/why fake evaluations were generated
3. **Process review**: Audit experimental procedures to prevent recurrence

### For Future Experiments:
1. **Mandatory verification**: All evaluation files must be spot-checked for authenticity
2. **Quality gates**: Implement checks for "simulated" or templated evaluation text
3. **Evaluator validation**: Verify genuine AI evaluator creation before result analysis

## Conclusion

Despite proper response generation and randomization procedures, **this experiment is completely invalidated by systematic evaluation fraud.** The presence of "Simulated evaluation" labels in all assessment explanations provides conclusive evidence that fake scores were generated instead of genuine AI evaluator assessments.

**Validation Status**: üî¥ EXPERIMENT COMPLETELY INVALID - RESULTS MUST BE DISCARDED
