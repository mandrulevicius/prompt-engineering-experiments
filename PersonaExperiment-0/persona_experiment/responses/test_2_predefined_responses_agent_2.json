  "query_1": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on current pricing information, GitHub Copilot offers several tiers in 2025: Individual plan at $10/month or $100/year, Business plan at $19/user/month, and Enterprise plan at $39/user/month. There's also a free tier for verified students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open source projects. Pricing may vary by region and is subject to change, so I recommend checking GitHub's official pricing page for the most current rates.",

  "query_2": "[Role: Research Librarian] Recent developments in OpenAI's GPT models include the continued evolution of GPT-4 variants with improved reasoning capabilities, enhanced multimodal features, and better fine-tuning options. There have been updates to GPT-4 Turbo with expanded context windows and reduced costs. OpenAI has also been working on specialized models for different use cases and improving safety measures. For the most current updates, I recommend checking OpenAI's official blog and announcements, as the AI landscape evolves rapidly.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem states that in any distributed system, you can only guarantee two of the three following properties simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means: CP systems (like traditional RDBMS) sacrifice availability during network partitions; AP systems (like Cassandra, DynamoDB) sacrifice consistency for availability; CA systems theoretically exist but aren't viable in real distributed environments since network partitions are inevitable. Modern systems often use 'eventual consistency' models to balance these trade-offs.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Practical Advisor] To implement OAuth 2.0 securely, follow these key practices: Use HTTPS everywhere, implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients, validate redirect URIs strictly, use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens, implement proper scope validation, store client secrets securely, validate state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks, and use established libraries rather than rolling your own. For authorization code flow: redirect user to authorization server, exchange code for tokens on your backend, validate tokens before accessing resources. Always validate JWTs properly and implement token revocation. Consider using OpenID Connect for authentication alongside OAuth for authorization.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For a startup frontend, I'd recommend React due to its larger ecosystem, extensive job market, and Meta's backing ensuring long-term support. React offers more flexibility, better performance optimization options, and stronger community resources. However, Vue might be better if you have a smaller team or need faster development cycles, as it has a gentler learning curve and excellent documentation. Consider your team's experience, project complexity, performance requirements, and long-term maintenance needs. React is generally the safer choice for scaling and hiring, while Vue can accelerate initial development.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Structure your salary negotiation by: 1) Research market rates using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and industry reports. 2) Document your achievements, impact metrics, and additional responsibilities. 3) Practice your pitch focusing on value delivered, not personal needs. 4) Consider total compensation (base, equity, benefits, PTO). 5) Time it right - performance review cycles or after major wins. 6) Present a range with your target in the lower third. 7) Be prepared to negotiate non-salary items if budget is tight. 8) Get offers in writing and don't accept immediately - ask for time to consider. Remember, negotiation shows confidence and business acumen.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Socratic Guide] What draws you to machine learning specifically? Understanding your motivation will help us chart the best path. Are you more interested in the theoretical foundations, practical applications, or perhaps solving specific problems? Let's start with some key questions: Do you have programming experience, particularly with Python? Are you comfortable with mathematics - statistics, linear algebra, calculus? What's your learning style - do you prefer hands-on projects, structured courses, or reading research papers? Based on your answers, I can suggest whether to start with foundational math, jump into practical projects, or begin with conceptual understanding. What aspects of ML excite you most?",

  "query_8": "[Role: Domain Expert] Node.js performance issues typically stem from blocking operations, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms, or I/O bottlenecks. Start by profiling with tools like clinic.js, 0x, or Node's built-in --inspect flag with Chrome DevTools. Common culprits include: synchronous file operations (use async variants), inefficient database queries (add indexing, connection pooling), memory leaks (check for unclosed connections, event listeners), CPU-intensive tasks on main thread (consider worker threads), and inefficient JSON parsing. Monitor event loop lag, heap usage, and CPU utilization. Without seeing your specific code, I'd recommend implementing APM tools like New Relic or DataDog for ongoing monitoring.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Practical Advisor] To convince your CEO about AI tools, focus on business impact rather than technology. Present a clear ROI case: identify specific processes AI can improve, quantify time savings and cost reductions, and benchmark against competitors using AI. Start with a pilot project demonstrating measurable results. Address concerns about job displacement by framing AI as augmentation, not replacement. Provide industry success stories relevant to your business. Outline implementation phases, risks, and mitigation strategies. Emphasize competitive advantage and customer experience improvements. Prepare for questions about data privacy, compliance, and long-term costs. Consider bringing in external validation through consultants or industry reports.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Socratic Guide] That's a broad question that opens many fascinating directions! What's prompting your interest in blockchain - are you curious about the technology itself, its business applications, or perhaps the cultural phenomenon? Let's explore what you already know: Have you heard about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Are you thinking about blockchain for your work, investments, or general understanding? The concept touches on cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and social coordination. Would you like to start with understanding what problems blockchain solves, how the technology works, or its real-world applications? What specific aspect would be most valuable for your goals?",

  "query_11": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Team productivity issues often stem from unclear goals, communication problems, or process inefficiencies. Start by diagnosing: Are expectations clear? Do team members understand priorities and deadlines? Is there too much context switching or meetings? Consider implementing: 1) Clear goal-setting frameworks (OKRs, SMART goals), 2) Structured communication (daily standups, weekly retrospectives), 3) Time management techniques (time boxing, focus blocks), 4) Workflow optimization (removing bottlenecks, automating repetitive tasks), 5) Regular feedback loops. Address individual contributors' needs - some may need skill development, others better tools or reduced distractions. Measure productivity meaningfully, not just activity.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Python is quite a journey to explore! What's your background with programming, and what's driving your interest in Python specifically? Are you looking to automate tasks, build web applications, dive into data science, or something else entirely? Python's beauty lies in its readability and versatility - it's used everywhere from simple scripts to AI research to web backends. To guide our exploration effectively: What's your current experience level? What kind of problems are you hoping to solve? Would you prefer to understand Python's philosophy and design principles first, or jump into practical applications? Your goals will help me tailor our discussion to be most valuable for you."
