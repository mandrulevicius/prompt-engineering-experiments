  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in any distributed system, you can only guarantee two of three properties simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (the system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (the system continues despite network failures). In practice, this means you must make trade-offs. CP systems (like traditional RDBMS with ACID properties) sacrifice availability during network partitions to maintain consistency. AP systems (like many NoSQL databases) remain available during partitions but may serve stale data. CA systems only work in networks without partitions, making them impractical for distributed systems. Modern distributed systems often use eventual consistency models, accepting temporary inconsistency for better availability and performance. Understanding CAP helps architects choose appropriate technologies: use CP for financial systems requiring strict consistency, AP for social media where availability matters more than perfect consistency.",

  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires following several best practices. Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for web and mobile applications, never the implicit flow. Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. Use HTTPS everywhere and validate SSL certificates. Store access tokens securely (never in localStorage for web apps), preferably in HttpOnly cookies or secure storage. Implement proper token validation, including signature verification for JWTs. Use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) with refresh tokens for extended access. Validate redirect URIs strictly against a whitelist. Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege. Use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than rolling your own implementation. Monitor for suspicious activity and implement rate limiting. For client secrets, store them securely and rotate regularly. Consider using OpenID Connect for authentication scenarios, and always validate the audience and issuer claims in tokens.",

  "query_5": "Choosing between React and Vue for your startup depends on several factors. React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market availability, and extensive corporate backing from Meta. It's excellent for complex applications with heavy state management needs and has superior TypeScript support. The learning curve is steeper but pays off for scalable applications. Vue provides a gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and faster development for simpler applications. It offers good performance out-of-the-box and has a more opinionated structure that can speed up development. Consider React if you need extensive third-party integrations, plan to scale your team quickly, or require advanced state management. Choose Vue if you want faster initial development, have a smaller team, or prioritize developer experience and simplicity. Both are excellent choices with strong communities. Your team's existing expertise and the specific requirements of your application should ultimately guide your decision.",

  "query_6": "Salary negotiations as a senior engineer require preparation and strategic approach. Research market rates using sites like levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind, accounting for your location, company size, and specific skills. Document your achievements with quantifiable impact: performance improvements, cost savings, successful projects led, and team mentoring. Time negotiations strategically, typically during performance reviews, after successful project completions, or when receiving competing offers. Present your case professionally, focusing on value delivered rather than personal needs. Consider the total compensation package: base salary, bonuses, equity, benefits, and work-life balance perks. Be prepared to negotiate non-salary items if base pay is inflexible. Practice your pitch beforehand and be ready to discuss your career growth and future contributions. If initial negotiations aren't successful, ask about a timeline for reconsideration and what milestones would support a future increase. Always maintain professionalism and consider your relationship with management long-term.",

  "query_7": "Starting machine learning as a complete beginner requires a structured approach. Begin with foundational mathematics: linear algebra, statistics, and basic calculus. Python is the most beginner-friendly language for ML, so learn Python basics first. Start with accessible courses like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera or fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning. Focus on understanding core concepts before diving into complex algorithms: supervised vs unsupervised learning, training/validation/test splits, overfitting, and evaluation metrics. Use beginner-friendly tools like scikit-learn for traditional ML and TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning. Practice with well-known datasets like iris, Boston housing, or MNIST. Build simple projects: start with linear regression, move to classification problems, then try image recognition. Join communities like Kaggle for competitions and learning. Read 'Hands-On Machine Learning' by Aurélien Géron for practical implementation. Don't rush into advanced topics; master the fundamentals first. Expect 6-12 months of consistent study to become proficient.",

  "query_8": "Debugging Node.js performance issues requires systematic investigation. Start with profiling tools: use Node.js built-in profiler (--prof flag) or tools like clinic.js, 0x, or Chrome DevTools. Monitor key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, event loop delay, and response times. Common performance bottlenecks include: synchronous operations blocking the event loop (use async alternatives), memory leaks (monitor with heapdump), inefficient database queries (add query logging and indexing), large JSON parsing (stream processing for large payloads), and inefficient algorithms in hot code paths. Use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or DataDog for production insights. Check for proper error handling that might cause resource leaks. Optimize database connections with connection pooling. Consider clustering for CPU-intensive tasks. Profile memory usage to identify leaks using heap snapshots. Use load testing tools like Artillery or k6 to simulate realistic conditions. Review your middleware stack for unnecessary processing and implement caching strategies where appropriate.",

  "query_9": "Convincing your CEO to adopt AI tools requires a business-focused approach emphasizing ROI and competitive advantage. Start by identifying specific use cases relevant to your business: customer service automation, data analysis, content generation, or process optimization. Prepare concrete examples from your industry showing measurable benefits: cost reduction, efficiency gains, or revenue increases. Address common concerns about cost, security, and job displacement with factual information and mitigation strategies. Propose a pilot program with limited scope to demonstrate value with minimal risk. Present competitive analysis showing how rivals are using AI successfully. Quantify potential benefits in business terms: reduced operational costs, faster time-to-market, improved customer satisfaction scores. Discuss implementation strategies that minimize disruption and include proper training. Address security and compliance concerns with specific solutions and vendor evaluations. Prepare a phased rollout plan with clear milestones and success metrics. Emphasize that AI augments rather than replaces human capabilities. Consider bringing in external consultants or industry experts to validate your recommendations if needed.",

  "query_10": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography. Key concepts include: decentralization (no central authority), immutability (records cannot be easily altered), transparency (transactions are visible), and consensus mechanisms (agreement protocols like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake). Primary applications include cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum), smart contracts (self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code), supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Benefits include reduced intermediary costs, increased security through cryptography, and improved transparency. However, challenges include scalability limitations, high energy consumption (particularly Proof of Work), regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Different types exist: public blockchains (open to everyone), private blockchains (restricted access), and consortium blockchains (semi-decentralized). Consider blockchain when you need trustless transactions, immutable records, or decentralized consensus, but evaluate whether traditional databases might suffice for your use case.",

  "query_11": "Improving team productivity requires addressing multiple dimensions systematically. Start by identifying bottlenecks through team retrospectives and individual conversations. Common issues include unclear priorities, excessive meetings, context switching, technical debt, and communication gaps. Implement clear goal-setting with OKRs or similar frameworks, ensuring everyone understands priorities and success metrics. Optimize meeting culture: audit current meetings, eliminate unnecessary ones, and make remaining meetings more effective with clear agendas and outcomes. Address technical productivity: invest in better tooling, automate repetitive tasks, and allocate time for technical debt reduction. Improve communication with asynchronous tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, documented processes, and regular check-ins. Consider team structure and workload distribution - ensure skills are properly matched to tasks and work is evenly distributed. Implement code review processes and pair programming to maintain quality while sharing knowledge. Focus on developer experience: fast CI/CD pipelines, good development environments, and minimal friction in workflows. Measure what matters: deployment frequency, lead time, and team satisfaction rather than just output metrics.",

  "query_12": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Key features include dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and extensive standard libraries. It's widely used in web development (Django, Flask), data science and machine learning (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), automation and scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. Python's syntax is beginner-friendly, making it excellent for new programmers, while remaining powerful enough for complex applications. The language has a large, active community and extensive ecosystem of third-party packages available through PyPI (Python Package Index). Popular implementations include CPython (the standard), PyPy (faster execution), and Jython (runs on JVM). Python is interpreted rather than compiled, which can make it slower than compiled languages but offers advantages in development speed and flexibility. It's an excellent choice for rapid prototyping, data analysis, web development, and automation tasks."
