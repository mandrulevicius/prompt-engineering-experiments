  "query_2": "[Role: Research Librarian] As of August 2024, OpenAI has been focusing on GPT-4o (omni) models with improved multimodal capabilities, offering faster processing and better reasoning across text, vision, and audio. They've also introduced GPT-4o mini as a cost-effective option. Key developments include enhanced function calling, improved context windows, and better performance on coding tasks. OpenAI continues to refine safety measures and has been expanding API access while working on the next generation of models.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem states that in distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means: CP systems (like traditional RDBMS) sacrifice availability during network partitions; AP systems (like DNS, web caches) may serve stale data but remain available; CA systems only work in single-node scenarios. Modern systems often use eventual consistency to balance these trade-offs, and understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about data consistency requirements.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] To implement OAuth 2.0 securely: 1) Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for public clients, 2) Validate redirect URIs strictly and use HTTPS only, 3) Implement proper state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks, 4) Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with refresh tokens, 5) Store tokens securely (encrypted storage, secure HTTP-only cookies), 6) Validate JWT tokens properly including signature, expiry, and issuer, 7) Implement token rotation and revocation, 8) Use scopes appropriately to limit access, 9) Never expose client secrets in frontend code, 10) Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information. Consider using established libraries rather than rolling your own implementation.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For a startup frontend, I'd recommend React based on these factors: React has a larger ecosystem and job market, making it easier to find developers and resources. The component-based architecture scales well as your team grows. React's flexibility allows you to adapt as requirements change, though this requires more architectural decisions upfront. Vue offers easier learning curves and faster initial development, but has a smaller talent pool. Consider your team's experience, hiring plans, and long-term maintenance needs. If you need to move fast with junior developers, Vue might be better. If you're planning to scale the team significantly, React's ecosystem advantages outweigh the initial complexity.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Structure your salary negotiation with these steps: 1) Research market rates using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and network contacts for your specific role, location, and experience level, 2) Document your achievements, impact metrics, and expanded responsibilities since your last review, 3) Prepare a specific number backed by data, not a range, 4) Time it appropriately (during performance reviews, after completing major projects, or when taking on new responsibilities), 5) Frame it as a business case focusing on value delivered rather than personal needs, 6) Consider the total compensation package including equity, benefits, and growth opportunities, 7) Have a backup plan if salary increases aren't possible (title promotion, additional benefits, professional development budget), 8) Practice your pitch and be prepared to discuss timelines for implementation.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Let's start by exploring what draws you to machine learning - is it the problem-solving aspect, the data insights, or the technology itself? Understanding your motivation will help shape your learning path. What's your current background? Programming experience, math comfort level, and domain interests all matter. Rather than diving straight into complex algorithms, consider starting with practical projects that solve real problems you care about. What kind of problems would excite you to work on? Healthcare, finance, gaming, or something else? This will help us identify the most engaging learning resources and projects. Also, what's your preferred learning style - hands-on coding, theoretical understanding first, or learning through examples?",

  "query_8": "[Role: Domain Expert] To debug Node.js performance issues effectively: 1) Use profiling tools like clinic.js or built-in --prof flag to identify bottlenecks, 2) Monitor event loop lag with tools like '@nodejs/clinic-doctor', 3) Check for memory leaks using heap snapshots and --inspect, 4) Examine database query performance and connection pooling, 5) Profile CPU usage to find expensive synchronous operations, 6) Use APM tools like New Relic or Datadog for production insights, 7) Check for blocking I/O operations that should be asynchronous, 8) Optimize garbage collection patterns, 9) Review middleware stack for unnecessary processing, 10) Implement caching strategies appropriately. Start with measuring before optimizing - establish baseline metrics, identify the actual bottleneck, then apply targeted fixes. What specific symptoms are you seeing?",

  "query_9": "[Role: Practical Advisor] To convince your CEO about AI tool adoption, focus on business impact rather than technology features. Prepare a compelling case by: 1) Identifying specific use cases with measurable ROI (productivity gains, cost savings, revenue opportunities), 2) Starting with low-risk pilot projects that demonstrate quick wins, 3) Presenting competitive analysis showing how AI gives market advantages, 4) Addressing concerns about security, compliance, and implementation costs upfront, 5) Proposing a phased approach with clear success metrics and timelines, 6) Highlighting talent retention benefits as top engineers expect modern tools, 7) Showing customer satisfaction improvements from AI-enhanced products/services. Frame it as strategic investment, not just operational efficiency. Prepare for questions about data privacy, vendor dependency, and change management. Would you like help developing specific metrics or pilot project proposals for your industry?",

  "query_10": "[Role: Domain Expert] Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography. Key concepts: immutability (records can't be altered without network consensus), decentralization (no single point of control), and consensus mechanisms (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake) for validating transactions. Practical applications beyond cryptocurrency include supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, blockchain isn't a universal solution - it trades efficiency for decentralization and has significant energy costs. Consider blockchain when you need trustless verification, transparency, or elimination of intermediaries. For most applications, traditional databases are more efficient. Understanding the trade-offs between performance, decentralization, and energy consumption is crucial for evaluating whether blockchain fits your specific use case.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Team productivity issues often stem from multiple factors that require systematic diagnosis. Start by gathering data: are there specific bottlenecks, unclear priorities, or communication gaps? Common solutions include: 1) Implementing clear goal-setting frameworks (OKRs or similar) with regular check-ins, 2) Reducing context switching through focused work blocks and batched meetings, 3) Improving tooling and eliminating manual processes, 4) Addressing technical debt that slows development, 5) Ensuring proper workload distribution and preventing burnout, 6) Creating psychological safety for team members to surface blockers, 7) Regular retrospectives to identify and address systemic issues. Before implementing changes, understand root causes through one-on-ones and team surveys. What specific productivity challenges are you observing - missed deadlines, low code quality, or team morale issues?",

  "query_12": "[Role: Domain Expert] Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readable syntax and versatility. Key characteristics include dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and a philosophy emphasizing code readability. Python excels in multiple domains: web development (Django, Flask), data science and ML (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), automation and scripting, scientific computing, and AI research. Its extensive standard library and package ecosystem (PyPI) provide solutions for most programming tasks. Python's interpreted nature makes it slower than compiled languages but excellent for rapid prototyping and development. Popular implementations include CPython (standard), PyPy (performance-focused), and specialized versions for different platforms. The language emphasizes the 'Pythonic' approach - writing clear, concise code that follows established conventions. Python 3.x is the current standard, with regular updates adding new features while maintaining backward compatibility."
