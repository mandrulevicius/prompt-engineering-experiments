  "query_1": "[Role: Tech Industry Research Analyst] Based on my analysis of GitHub's current pricing structure as of 2024-2025, GitHub Copilot offers several tiers: Individual ($10/month or $100/year), Business ($19/user/month), and Enterprise ($39/user/month). The Individual plan includes code suggestions, chat features, and CLI integration. Business adds centralized billing and policy management, while Enterprise provides additional security and compliance features. Students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open-source projects can access Copilot for free. Note that pricing may vary by region and GitHub occasionally offers promotional rates.",

  "query_2": "[Role: AI Industry News Correspondent] As of early 2025, OpenAI continues to lead with GPT-4 and its variants, while also developing more specialized models. Key recent developments include improvements in reasoning capabilities, multimodal processing, and efficiency optimizations. The company has been focusing on enterprise applications and API reliability. However, I should note that my knowledge has a cutoff date, so for the very latest announcements, I'd recommend checking OpenAI's official blog, tech news sites like TechCrunch or The Verge, or OpenAI's Twitter account for real-time updates on model releases and capabilities.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Distributed Systems Architect] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that any distributed system can guarantee at most two of these three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). In practice, network partitions are inevitable, so you must choose between CP (consistent but potentially unavailable) or AP (available but potentially inconsistent). Examples: Traditional RDBMS choose CP, while systems like DynamoDB choose AP. Modern approaches use eventual consistency and techniques like vector clocks, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and consensus algorithms (Raft, PBFT) to manage these trade-offs intelligently.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Security Engineer] Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires several critical practices: 1) Use HTTPS everywhere, 2) Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients, 3) Validate redirect URIs strictly, 4) Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens, 5) Implement proper state parameters to prevent CSRF, 6) Store client secrets securely (never in client-side code), 7) Validate all tokens and implement proper scope checking, 8) Use established libraries rather than rolling your own, 9) Implement rate limiting and monitoring for suspicious activities, 10) Regular security audits of your implementation. Consider using Authorization Code flow for web apps and Implicit flow only when absolutely necessary with additional security measures.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technical Advisor] For a startup frontend choice, consider these factors: React has a larger ecosystem, more job market availability, and better performance for complex applications, but has a steeper learning curve. Vue offers gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and good performance, but smaller ecosystem and job market. Given startup constraints, I'd lean toward React if: you have experienced developers, plan complex features, need extensive third-party integrations. Choose Vue if: you have junior developers, need rapid prototyping, want simpler state management. Also consider your team's existing skills, hiring plans, and long-term maintenance capabilities. Both are excellent choices - the 'right' answer depends more on your specific context than technical superiority.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Senior Engineering Career Coach] Salary negotiation as a senior engineer should leverage your proven value and market position. Research thoroughly using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and industry reports for your specific role/location. Prepare a compelling case highlighting: quantifiable achievements, technical leadership examples, mentoring impact, and business outcomes you've driven. Timing matters - negotiate at performance reviews, job offers, or after major accomplishments. Don't just discuss base salary; consider equity, bonuses, benefits, PTO, learning budget, and flexible work arrangements. Practice your pitch, be confident but respectful, and be prepared to walk away if the offer doesn't meet your standards. Remember, as a senior engineer, you're not just selling technical skills but leadership and strategic thinking.",

  "query_7": "[Role: ML Learning Path Mentor] Starting ML as a complete beginner is exciting! Here's your roadmap: First, strengthen math foundations (linear algebra, statistics, basic calculus) - Khan Academy and 3Blue1Brown are excellent. Learn Python programming if you haven't already. Start with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course (Coursera) or Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning course. Practice with hands-on projects using scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. Build a portfolio with real datasets from Kaggle. Key beginner projects: predicting house prices, image classification, sentiment analysis. Join communities like r/MachineLearning, ML Twitter, and local meetups. Remember: focus on understanding concepts over memorizing formulas, practice consistently, and don't rush into complex deep learning without solid foundations.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Node.js Performance Specialist] Let's diagnose your Node.js performance issue systematically. Start with profiling using built-in tools: `node --prof app.js` and analyze with `node --prof-process`. Check for common culprits: 1) Memory leaks - use `process.memoryUsage()` and heap snapshots, 2) Blocking operations - ensure async/await usage, avoid synchronous file operations, 3) Database query optimization - check for N+1 queries, missing indexes, 4) Event loop blocking - use `clinic.js` or `0x` for flame graphs. Monitor key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and event loop lag. Without seeing your specific code, I'd recommend: enable logging with performance timing, use APM tools like New Relic or DataDog, and implement proper error handling. Share specific symptoms or code snippets for more targeted guidance.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Enterprise AI Strategy Consultant] Convincing your CEO to adopt AI tools requires a business-focused approach. Present AI adoption as a competitive necessity, not just a nice-to-have. Build your case around: 1) Competitive advantage - show how competitors are gaining market share through AI, 2) ROI projections - calculate productivity gains, cost savings, and revenue opportunities, 3) Risk mitigation - highlight the cost of falling behind, 4) Pilot program proposal - suggest low-risk, high-impact initial implementations. Use concrete examples: customer service chatbots reducing response times, predictive analytics improving inventory management, or code assistance tools increasing developer productivity. Address concerns about cost, security, and job displacement proactively. Propose starting with proven, vendor-supported solutions rather than custom development. Frame it as essential digital transformation, not experimental technology.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Blockchain Technology Educator] Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography. Key concepts: decentralization (no single point of failure), immutability (records can't be easily changed), transparency (transactions are publicly visible), and consensus mechanisms (how network agrees on validity). Main applications include cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum), smart contracts (self-executing contracts), supply chain tracking, and digital identity verification. However, blockchain isn't a silver bullet - it has limitations like high energy consumption, scalability challenges, and regulatory uncertainty. Consider blockchain when you need: trustless transactions, auditability, decentralization, or removing intermediaries. Avoid it for: high-speed transactions, frequently changing data, or when traditional databases suffice. Focus on understanding the problem blockchain solves rather than the technology itself.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Engineering Team Management Consultant] Team productivity issues often stem from systemic problems rather than individual performance. Conduct a productivity audit examining: 1) Process bottlenecks - excessive meetings, unclear requirements, lengthy approval chains, 2) Technical debt - outdated tools, poor infrastructure, manual processes that should be automated, 3) Communication gaps - unclear priorities, information silos, insufficient feedback loops, 4) Workload distribution - overloaded team members, skill mismatches, context switching. Solutions might include: implementing agile practices, investing in developer tools, establishing clear goals and metrics, improving documentation, and regular retrospectives. Measure productivity meaningfully - not just lines of code or hours worked, but business outcomes, cycle time, and team satisfaction. Consider external factors like organizational changes, market pressures, or burnout. Address the root causes, not just symptoms.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Programming Language Guide] Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it emphasizes code readability with significant indentation. Key strengths include: simple, English-like syntax making it beginner-friendly; extensive standard library and third-party packages; strong communities in web development (Django, Flask), data science (pandas, NumPy), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and automation. Python is interpreted rather than compiled, which means slower execution but faster development cycles. It's dynamically typed and supports multiple programming paradigms. Major versions are Python 2 (legacy) and Python 3 (current). Common use cases: web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation scripts, and rapid prototyping. Great for beginners due to gentle learning curve, but powerful enough for complex enterprise applications."
