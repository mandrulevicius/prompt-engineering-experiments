  "query_3": "[Role: Distributed Systems Architecture Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that distributed systems can guarantee at most two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). In practice, network partitions are inevitable, so you must choose between CP (consistent but potentially unavailable during partitions) or AP (available but potentially inconsistent). Real-world implications: CP systems like traditional RDBMS prioritize data correctness for financial transactions, while AP systems like DNS or social media feeds prioritize user experience over perfect consistency.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Cybersecurity Implementation Specialist] To implement OAuth 2.0 securely, follow these critical practices: 1) Use HTTPS exclusively for all communications, 2) Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients, 3) Validate redirect URIs strictly against a whitelist, 4) Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with refresh token rotation, 5) Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies or secure storage), 6) Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege, 7) Use state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks, 8) Validate all tokens server-side, and 9) Monitor for suspicious authorization patterns. Consider using established libraries like Passport.js, Spring Security, or Auth0 rather than building from scratch.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technology Consultant] For your startup's frontend choice, I recommend React if you need a mature ecosystem with extensive third-party libraries, have a team familiar with JavaScript/JSX, require complex state management, or plan to scale rapidly with a large development team. Choose Vue if you want gentler learning curves, prefer template-based syntax, need faster development cycles with smaller teams, or value comprehensive official tooling. Consider your team's existing skills, project timeline, hiring market in your area, and long-term maintenance needs. React has broader job market availability, while Vue often enables faster initial development for smaller teams.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Senior Engineering Career Advisor] For salary negotiations as a senior engineer: 1) Research market rates using Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and local salary surveys for your specific role/location, 2) Document your achievements quantitatively (performance improvements, cost savings, team leadership), 3) Time negotiations strategically (performance reviews, job offers, after major project completions), 4) Negotiate total compensation (base, equity, bonus, benefits, PTO), not just salary, 5) Present a compelling case focusing on value delivered and market positioning, 6) Be prepared to walk away and have alternatives, 7) Consider non-monetary benefits (remote work, professional development, title progression), and 8) Maintain professional relationships throughout the process. Practice your pitch and anticipate counteroffers.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Machine Learning Learning Path Mentor] As a complete ML beginner, start with this structured approach: 1) Strengthen math foundations (linear algebra, statistics, basic calculus) using Khan Academy or 3Blue1Brown videos, 2) Learn Python basics and key libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), 3) Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera for solid fundamentals, 4) Practice with hands-on projects using datasets from Kaggle Learn modules, 5) Focus on understanding concepts before diving into deep learning, 6) Build projects that interest you (recommendation systems, image classification, text analysis), 7) Join communities like r/MachineLearning or local ML meetups. Expect 6-12 months of consistent learning. Start with supervised learning problems - they're most intuitive for beginners.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Node.js Performance Debugging Specialist] To debug your Node.js performance issue, follow this systematic approach: 1) Profile your application using Node.js built-in profiler (--prof flag) or tools like clinic.js or 0x, 2) Monitor key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, event loop lag, and response times, 3) Check for common bottlenecks: synchronous operations blocking the event loop, memory leaks, inefficient database queries, unoptimized algorithms, 4) Use APM tools like New Relic, DataDog, or open-source alternatives like Elastic APM, 5) Enable production logging and analyze slow endpoints, 6) Review database query performance and implement caching where appropriate, 7) Consider horizontal scaling or clustering. Share your specific symptoms (high CPU, memory growth, slow responses) for more targeted advice.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Enterprise AI Adoption Strategist] To convince your CEO about AI tool adoption, focus on business impact: 1) Present concrete ROI projections with specific use cases (customer service automation saving X hours, code generation increasing developer productivity by Y%), 2) Highlight competitive advantages and market positioning risks of falling behind, 3) Start with low-risk pilot programs showing measurable results, 4) Address concerns about cost, security, and job displacement with clear mitigation strategies, 5) Benchmark against industry leaders already using AI successfully, 6) Propose a phased implementation plan with clear success metrics, 7) Emphasize employee satisfaction and retention benefits, 8) Prepare for questions about data privacy, vendor reliability, and integration challenges. Frame AI as augmentation, not replacement, of human capabilities.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Blockchain Technology Educator] Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography. Key concepts to understand: 1) Decentralization - no single point of control or failure, 2) Immutability - records are extremely difficult to alter once added, 3) Consensus mechanisms - how the network agrees on valid transactions (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake), 4) Smart contracts - self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. Practical applications include cryptocurrencies, supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, consider limitations: energy consumption, scalability challenges, regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity before implementation.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Engineering Team Management Coach] To address your team's productivity issues, diagnose the root cause first: 1) Conduct anonymous surveys and one-on-ones to identify specific blockers (unclear requirements, technical debt, tool limitations, process overhead), 2) Analyze your development workflow for bottlenecks (code review delays, deployment friction, meeting overload), 3) Implement measurement without micromanagement (cycle time, lead time, deployment frequency), 4) Focus on removing impediments rather than pushing harder, 5) Consider team dynamics - communication issues, skill gaps, motivation problems, 6) Streamline processes and reduce context switching, 7) Invest in tooling and automation to eliminate repetitive tasks, 8) Ensure clear priorities and protect deep work time. Address systemic issues rather than individual performance initially.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Programming Language Guide] Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readable syntax and versatility. Key strengths include: extensive standard library, strong community support, excellent for beginners, powerful in data science/ML (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow), web development (Django, Flask), automation, and scripting.
