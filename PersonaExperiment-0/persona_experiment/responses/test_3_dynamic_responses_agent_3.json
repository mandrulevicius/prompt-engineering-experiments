  "query_3": "[Role: Distributed Systems Expert] The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, states that any distributed system can guarantee at most two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). In practice, network partitions are inevitable, so you must choose between consistency and availability. CP systems (like traditional RDBMS) sacrifice availability for consistency, while AP systems (like eventual consistency NoSQL databases) sacrifice strong consistency for availability. Real-world implications include: choosing MongoDB (CP) for financial transactions requiring accuracy, or Cassandra (AP) for social media feeds where temporary inconsistency is acceptable.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Cybersecurity Implementation Specialist] To implement OAuth 2.0 securely, follow these critical practices: 1) Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients, 2) Implement proper state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks, 3) Validate redirect URIs strictly and use HTTPS only, 4) Store access tokens securely (never in localStorage for web apps), 5) Implement proper token refresh mechanisms, 6) Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with longer refresh tokens, 7) Validate JWT signatures if using JWT tokens, 8) Implement proper scope validation, and 9) Use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than rolling your own implementation. Always sanitize and validate all inputs and responses.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technology Consultant] For a startup frontend choice, consider these factors: React offers a larger talent pool, extensive ecosystem, and better job market for hiring, making it safer for scaling your team. Vue provides gentler learning curves, excellent documentation, and faster development cycles, which can accelerate initial product development. Given your startup context, I'd recommend React if you anticipate rapid team growth and complex application requirements, or Vue if you prioritize development speed and have a smaller, focused team. Both are production-ready, so your decision should align with your team's expertise, hiring plans, and long-term technical strategy rather than pure technical merits.",
