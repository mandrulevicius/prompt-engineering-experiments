  "query_3": "[Role: Research Librarian] The CAP theorem, formulated by computer scientist Eric Brewer in 2000, states that distributed systems can provide at most two of three guarantees simultaneously: **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously. **Availability**: The system remains operational and responsive. **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues operating despite network failures or message loss between nodes. **Practical Implications**: Traditional RDBMS prioritize Consistency and Availability (CA) but struggle with network partitions. NoSQL systems typically choose: CP systems (like MongoDB, HBase) sacrifice availability during partitions to maintain consistency. AP systems (like Cassandra, DynamoDB) remain available during partitions but may serve inconsistent data. Real-world applications must carefully evaluate trade-offs based on business requirements. For example, financial systems typically prioritize consistency, while social media feeds can tolerate temporary inconsistency for availability. Modern systems often implement eventual consistency models to balance these constraints. Sources: Brewer's original theorem, distributed systems literature, case studies from major tech companies.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on current security best practices and RFC 6749 specifications, secure OAuth 2.0 implementation requires: **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**: Use Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636) to prevent authorization code interception attacks. **Secure Token Storage**: Store access tokens securely (encrypted, never in localStorage for web apps). Use secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage APIs. **Proper Redirect URI Validation**: Implement exact-match validation for redirect URIs to prevent redirect attacks. **State Parameter**: Always use cryptographically random state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks. **Scope Limitation**: Request minimal necessary scopes following principle of least privilege. **Token Lifecycle Management**: Implement proper token refresh flows, short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes), and secure refresh token rotation. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All OAuth endpoints must use HTTPS in production. **Client Authentication**: Use client_secret_post or client_secret_jwt for confidential clients. **Security Headers**: Implement proper CORS, CSP, and security headers. **Regular Security Audits**: Monitor for token leakage, implement proper logging, and conduct regular security reviews.

  "query_10": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on comprehensive blockchain research, technical documentation, and industry analysis: **Core Concepts**: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology providing immutable, transparent record-keeping through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms. Key components include blocks (data containers), hashes (unique identifiers), nodes (network participants), and consensus algorithms (validation methods). **Types and Applications**: Public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) offer decentralization but limited scalability. Private/consortium blockchains provide enterprise control with better performance. Applications span cryptocurrency, smart contracts, supply chain tracking, digital identity, healthcare records, and voting systems. **Technical Considerations**: Understand energy consumption implications (Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake), scalability challenges (Bitcoin: 7 TPS, Ethereum: 15 TPS vs traditional systems: thousands of TPS), and the blockchain trilemma (security, scalability, decentralization trade-offs). **Current Market State**: Enterprise adoption focuses on supply chain transparency, financial services (CBDCs, cross-border payments), and digital asset management. Major companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon offer blockchain-as-a-service platforms. **Limitations and Criticisms**: High energy consumption for some networks, scalability bottlenecks, regulatory uncertainty, and user experience challenges. Many proposed use cases may be better served by traditional databases. **Investment and Career Implications**: Research roles in distributed systems, smart contract development, or blockchain integration.
