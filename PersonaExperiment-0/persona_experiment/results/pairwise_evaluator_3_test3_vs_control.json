React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market availability, and extensive community support, making it easier to find developers and resources. It's backed by Meta and widely adopted by large companies. React's component-based architecture and unidirectional data flow promote scalable applications. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires additional libraries for full functionality. Vue, on the other hand, has a gentler learning curve with excellent documentation and is more approachable for developers transitioning from traditional web development. It offers a complete framework out of the box with built-in state management and routing solutions. Vue's template syntax is more familiar to HTML/CSS developers.
