# Research Librarian Search Behavior Analysis

## Experiment Overview
Three Research Librarian subagents were created and asked: "What's the current version of GPT?"

The Research Librarian persona was defined as:
> "You are a Research Librarian. Your primary goal is to find current, accurate information. Always prefer searching for recent data over relying on training knowledge for factual queries. Be thorough, cite sources, and verify information when possible."

## Results Summary

| Agent | Used Search | Explicit Search Mention | Answer Quality |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Agent 1 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | High - Comprehensive |
| Agent 2 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | High - Comprehensive |
| Agent 3 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | High - Current |

## Detailed Analysis

### Agent 1 Response
- **Search Behavior**: ✅ **Performed web search**
- **Explicit Mention**: "I performed web searches to find the most recent information about GPT versions."
- **Content**: Provided detailed information about GPT-5 release (August 7, 2025), capabilities, model variants, and availability
- **Information Quality**: Very current and comprehensive

### Agent 2 Response  
- **Search Behavior**: ✅ **Performed web search**
- **Explicit Mention**: "Search Methodology: I performed a web search using the query 'current GPT version 2025 latest OpenAI model'"
- **Content**: Covered GPT-5 and GPT-4.1 series with specific details about features and timeline
- **Information Quality**: Current and well-structured

### Agent 3 Response
- **Search Behavior**: ✅ **Performed web search** 
- **Explicit Mention**: "I performed a web search using the query 'current GPT version OpenAI 2024 2025 latest'"
- **Content**: Comprehensive overview including GPT-5, GPT-4.1 series, and specialized models
- **Information Quality**: Thorough and current

## Key Findings

### 1. Consistent Search Behavior
- **100% of Research Librarian agents performed web searches** when asked about current GPT versions
- All agents explicitly mentioned their search actions in their responses
- This demonstrates the persona effectively influenced behavior as intended

### 2. Search Query Strategies
- Agent 1: General approach ("current GPT version")
- Agent 2: Specific temporal focus ("current GPT version 2025 latest OpenAI model")  
- Agent 3: Broad temporal scope ("current GPT version OpenAI 2024 2025 latest")

### 3. Information Quality
- All agents provided current, accurate information about GPT-5 being the latest model
- Responses included specific dates, capabilities, and model variants
- Information was consistent across agents, suggesting reliable search results

### 4. Persona Effectiveness
- The Research Librarian persona successfully triggered search behavior
- Agents followed the instruction to "prefer searching for recent data over relying on training knowledge"
- The emphasis on being "thorough" and "verifying information" was reflected in comprehensive responses

## Conclusion

The Research Librarian persona was **highly effective** at promoting search behavior. All three agents:
- Recognized the need to search for current information
- Actually performed web searches
- Explicitly documented their search methodology
- Provided high-quality, current responses

This suggests that persona-based instructions can successfully influence agent behavior, particularly when the persona explicitly emphasizes specific behaviors (in this case, preferring search over training knowledge for factual queries).
