  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues to operate despite network failures). Practical implications include: Database design decisions - SQL databases typically prioritize consistency and availability (CA), while NoSQL systems like Cassandra focus on availability and partition tolerance (AP), and systems like MongoDB can be configured for consistency and partition tolerance (CP). In real-world scenarios, network partitions are inevitable, so you're essentially choosing between consistency and availability. This affects architecture decisions: financial systems often choose consistency over availability to prevent data corruption, while social media platforms might prioritize availability to keep users engaged even if some data is temporarily inconsistent.",

  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely involves several key practices: Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients like SPAs and mobile apps. Store client secrets securely on the server side and never expose them in client-side code. Implement proper state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks by generating a unique, unpredictable state value for each authorization request. Use HTTPS for all OAuth communications to prevent token interception. Implement short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes) with refresh tokens for longer sessions. Validate redirect URIs strictly - maintain a whitelist of allowed redirect URIs. Store tokens securely using httpOnly cookies or secure storage mechanisms. Implement proper token revocation and logout procedures. Regular security audits and staying updated with OAuth 2.1 improvements are also crucial. Consider using established libraries like Passport.js for Node.js or Spring Security for Java rather than implementing from scratch.",

  "query_5": "The choice between React and Vue for your startup depends on several factors. React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market availability, and extensive community support, making it easier to find developers and resources. It's backed by Meta and widely adopted by large companies. React's component-based architecture and unidirectional data flow promote scalable applications. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires additional libraries for full functionality. Vue, on the other hand, has a gentler learning curve with excellent documentation and is more approachable for developers transitioning from traditional web development. It offers a complete framework out of the box with built-in state management and routing solutions. Vue's template syntax is more familiar to HTML/CSS developers. For startups, consider your team's existing skills, timeline constraints, and long-term hiring plans. If you need to move fast with junior developers, Vue might be better. If you prioritize ecosystem size and future hiring flexibility, React could be the better choice.",

  "query_6": "Structuring salary negotiations as a senior engineer requires preparation and strategy. First, research market rates using sites like levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and salary surveys specific to your location and company size. Document your achievements, including quantifiable impacts on revenue, cost savings, or team productivity. Prepare a comprehensive case including technical leadership examples, mentoring contributions, and process improvements you've implemented. Time your negotiation strategically - ideally during performance reviews, after successful project completions, or when taking on additional responsibilities. Present your case professionally, focusing on value delivered rather than personal needs. Consider the total compensation package including equity, benefits, professional development budget, and flexible work arrangements. Be prepared to negotiate non-salary items if base salary flexibility is limited. Practice your pitch beforehand and anticipate counterarguments. Set a realistic target range and know your walk-away point. Remember that negotiation is often expected at senior levels, so approach it confidently and professionally.",

  "query_7": "Starting machine learning as a complete beginner can seem overwhelming, but here's a structured approach: Begin with foundational math concepts - basic statistics, linear algebra (vectors, matrices), and calculus fundamentals. Don't worry about mastering everything; focus on understanding concepts. For programming, Python is the most beginner-friendly choice with excellent ML libraries. Start with Python basics, then learn NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization. Take a structured course like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera or fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning course. Begin with supervised learning concepts - linear regression, classification, and decision trees before moving to more complex algorithms. Practice with real datasets from Kaggle or public data sources. Start with simple projects like predicting house prices or classifying images. Use tools like Jupyter notebooks for experimentation. Join communities like r/MachineLearning, ML Twitter, or local meetups. The key is consistent practice and building projects rather than getting stuck in tutorial hell.",

  "query_8": "Debugging Node.js performance issues requires a systematic approach. Start by identifying the bottleneck using profiling tools like Node.js built-in profiler (node --prof), clinic.js, or 0x for flame graphs. Monitor key metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, event loop lag, and response times using tools like New Relic, DataDog, or simple middleware. Common performance issues include: synchronous operations blocking the event loop - use asynchronous alternatives and worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks; memory leaks from unclosed connections, circular references, or excessive caching - use heap snapshots and tools like memwatch-next; inefficient database queries - implement query optimization, connection pooling, and proper indexing; unoptimized dependencies - audit npm packages with npm audit and consider lighter alternatives. Check for proper error handling to prevent crashes and implement graceful shutdowns. Use clustering to utilize multiple CPU cores and implement caching strategies (Redis, in-memory caching). Consider using PM2 for production process management. Profile in production-like environments since development performance can differ significantly.",

  "query_9": "Convincing your CEO to adopt AI tools requires a business-focused approach. Start by identifying specific pain points in your organization that AI can address - customer service response times, data analysis bottlenecks, or repetitive manual processes. Quantify the potential impact with concrete metrics: time savings, cost reductions, revenue opportunities, or competitive advantages. Present pilot project proposals with clear ROI projections and measurable success criteria. Address common concerns upfront: data security and privacy (explain security measures), implementation costs (show phased rollout plans), and employee displacement fears (emphasize augmentation over replacement). Provide industry examples and case studies relevant to your sector. Start small with low-risk, high-impact use cases to demonstrate value before proposing larger investments. Prepare for questions about accuracy, reliability, and ongoing maintenance costs. Emphasize the competitive risk of not adopting AI while competitors do. Consider bringing in external experts or consultants to validate your proposals. Frame AI adoption as essential for future competitiveness rather than just operational efficiency.",

  "query_10": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. Key characteristics include decentralization (no single point of control), immutability (extremely difficult to alter past records), and transparency (all transactions are visible). Beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has applications in supply chain management (tracking goods from origin to consumer), healthcare (secure patient records), voting systems (transparent, tamper-resistant elections), and smart contracts (self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code). However, blockchain faces challenges including scalability issues (limited transaction throughput), high energy consumption (especially proof-of-work systems), regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Different types exist: public blockchains (open to everyone), private blockchains (restricted access), and hybrid approaches. Consider blockchain when you need trustless transactions, immutable records, or decentralized consensus, but evaluate whether traditional databases might be more appropriate for centralized applications.",

  "query_11": "Addressing team productivity issues requires identifying root causes and implementing systematic solutions. Start by gathering data through one-on-one meetings, team surveys, and productivity metrics analysis. Common productivity killers include unclear requirements, frequent context switching, too many meetings, inadequate tools, technical debt, and poor communication. Solutions include: implementing agile methodologies with clear sprint goals and daily standups; establishing 'focus time' blocks with minimal meetings; investing in better development tools and automation; addressing technical debt through dedicated sprints; improving code review processes and documentation. Communication improvements might involve clearer project specifications, better stakeholder management, and regular retrospectives to identify and address blockers. Consider team dynamics - personality conflicts, skill gaps, or misaligned incentives can significantly impact productivity. Provide professional development opportunities and clear career paths to maintain motivation. Measure progress using meaningful metrics like cycle time, deployment frequency, and team satisfaction scores rather than just hours worked. Remember that sustainable productivity improvements take time and require consistent effort from leadership.",

  "query_12": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its clean syntax that often resembles English. It's dynamically typed and supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages make it versatile for various applications: web development (Django, Flask), data science and analytics (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), automation and scripting, scientific computing, and game development. Its interpreted nature makes it excellent for rapid prototyping and interactive development. Python's philosophy, captured in 'The Zen of Python,' emphasizes principles like 'Beautiful is better than ugly' and 'Simple is better than complex.' While Python can be slower than compiled languages like C++ for CPU-intensive tasks, its development speed and maintainability often outweigh performance concerns. Python 3 is the current version, with Python 2 officially deprecated. It's an excellent first language for beginners due to its gentle learning curve while remaining powerful enough for professional development."
