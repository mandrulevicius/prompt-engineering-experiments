  "query_1": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on my research of current pricing information, GitHub Copilot offers several tiers as of 2025: Individual plans typically start around $10/month, with Business plans at $19/user/month, and Enterprise options with custom pricing. However, I'd recommend checking GitHub's official pricing page for the most current rates, as these can change and may include promotional offers or regional variations.",
  
  "query_2": "[Role: Technology Journalist] The AI landscape moves incredibly fast! While I can't access real-time news, the most significant developments around OpenAI's GPT models typically include performance improvements, new capabilities, and pricing changes. For the absolute latest updates, I'd suggest checking OpenAI's official blog, their Twitter/X account, or tech news sources like TechCrunch, The Verge, or Ars Technica for breaking developments.",
  
  "query_3": "[Role: System Architecture Expert] The CAP theorem states that in distributed systems, you can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). In practice, this means choosing your trade-offs: SQL databases typically choose CA, NoSQL systems like Cassandra choose AP, while systems like MongoDB lean towards CP. The key insight is that network partitions are inevitable, so you're really choosing between consistency and availability.",
  
  "query_4": "[Role: Security Consultant] Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires several critical considerations: Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for public clients, always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks, implement proper token storage (secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens), use short-lived access tokens, validate all redirects against a whitelist, and ensure HTTPS everywhere. Consider using established libraries like Passport.js, Spring Security, or Auth0 rather than rolling your own implementation.",
  
  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technical Advisor] For a startup, I'd lean toward React in most cases. Here's my reasoning: React has a larger talent pool making hiring easier, more extensive ecosystem and third-party libraries, better long-term career prospects for your team, and strong backing from Meta. Vue is excellent and more approachable for beginners, but React's market dominance gives you more flexibility. That said, if your team has Vue experience or you need faster initial development, Vue is perfectly viable. The 'wrong' choice here won't kill your startup.",
  
  "query_6": "[Role: Career Coach] Salary negotiations as a senior engineer require preparation and confidence. Research your market value using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and local salary surveys. Document your achievements with metrics - reduced deployment time by X%, led team of Y people, delivered Z revenue impact. Present a range rather than a single number, with your target in the lower third. Focus on total compensation, not just base salary. Practice your pitch beforehand, stay professional even if initially declined, and remember that the worst they can say is no - but often they'll meet you somewhere in the middle.",
  
  "query_7": "[Role: Learning Mentor] Starting ML as a complete beginner can feel overwhelming, but here's a structured approach: Begin with Python fundamentals if you're not comfortable coding yet. Then take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera - it's the gold standard introduction. Follow up with hands-on practice using scikit-learn for classical ML and gradually move to deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch. Focus on understanding concepts before diving into math - you can always deepen the theory later. Start with simple projects like house price prediction before tackling complex neural networks.",
  
  "query_8": "[Role: Performance Engineering Specialist] Node.js performance issues often stem from a few common culprits: blocking the event loop with synchronous operations, memory leaks from unclosed resources or retained references, inefficient database queries, or CPU-intensive tasks running on the main thread. Start by profiling with Node.js built-in profiler or tools like clinic.js to identify bottlenecks. Check for async/await usage, ensure database connections are properly pooled, and consider worker threads for heavy computation. Share your specific symptoms and I can provide more targeted guidance.",
  
  "query_9": "[Role: Business Technology Strategist] To convince your CEO about AI tools, focus on business impact rather than technical features. Prepare a compelling case with concrete ROI projections - show how AI can reduce costs, increase efficiency, or create new revenue streams. Start with a small pilot project that delivers quick wins, present competitor analysis showing market adoption, and address concerns about implementation costs and risks upfront. Use specific examples relevant to your industry and emphasize how AI supports business objectives rather than just being 'cool technology.'",
  
  "query_10": "[Role: Technology Educator] Blockchain is essentially a distributed, immutable ledger that enables trust without intermediaries. Key concepts to understand: blocks contain transaction data and are cryptographically linked, consensus mechanisms validate transactions, and smart contracts automate agreements. Practical applications include cryptocurrencies, supply chain tracking, digital identity, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, be aware of limitations: energy consumption, scalability challenges, and regulatory uncertainty. Focus on understanding the problems blockchain solves rather than just the technology itself.",
  
  "query_11": "[Role: Team Management Consultant] Team productivity issues often stem from unclear goals, communication breakdowns, or process inefficiencies. Start with a team retrospective to identify specific pain points. Common solutions include: establishing clear priorities and deadlines, implementing regular check-ins without micromanaging, removing blockers quickly, ensuring team members have the right tools and training, and addressing any interpersonal conflicts directly. Consider whether the issue is individual performance, team dynamics, or systemic problems. Focus on measuring outcomes rather than just activity levels.",
  
  "query_12": "[Role: Programming Educator] Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly programming language known for its readable syntax and extensive ecosystem. It excels in web development (Django, Flask), data science (pandas, NumPy), automation/scripting, machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and general-purpose programming. Key strengths include rapid development, huge community support, and batteries-included standard library. It's interpreted rather than compiled, making it great for prototyping but potentially slower for performance-critical applications. Perfect for beginners due to its emphasis on code readability and intuitive syntax."
