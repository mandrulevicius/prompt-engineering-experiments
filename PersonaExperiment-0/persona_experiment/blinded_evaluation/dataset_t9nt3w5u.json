  "query_1": "[Role: Domain Expert] GitHub Copilot's pricing architecture reflects enterprise-grade SaaS monetization patterns. Individual subscriptions utilize a $10/month tier, while GitHub Copilot Business implements a $19/user/month enterprise model with centralized billing and administrative controls. The pricing differential encodes value-based segmentation - individual developers receive core autocomplete functionality, while enterprise customers access advanced features like policy management, audit logs, and IP indemnification. The underlying economic model leverages marginal cost structures typical of transformer-based inference systems, where compute costs scale sublinearly with user adoption due to batching optimizations and model serving efficiencies.",
  
  "query_2": "[Role: Domain Expert] OpenAI's latest architectural developments center on GPT-4o's multimodal integration and the o1 reasoning model series. GPT-4o implements unified tokenization across modalities using patch-based visual encoding and spectral audio processing, enabling cross-modal reasoning capabilities. The o1 series represents a paradigm shift toward chain-of-thought training methodologies, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with process-based reward modeling rather than outcome-only optimization. Recent developments include function calling enhancements with structured output schemas, fine-tuning capabilities for enterprise deployments, and inference optimization through speculative decoding techniques. The competitive landscape is driving architectural innovations in mixture-of-experts scaling and tool-use capabilities.",
  
  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem formally states that distributed systems can guarantee at most two of three properties: Consistency (linearizability), Availability (system operational time), and Partition tolerance (network failure resilience). The theorem's practical implications manifest in architectural trade-offs: CP systems like RDBMS with strict consistency sacrifice availability during network partitions, implementing techniques like two-phase commit or Raft consensus. AP systems like Cassandra or DynamoDB prioritize availability, accepting eventual consistency through vector clocks, gossip protocols, and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). Modern distributed systems employ nuanced approaches: MongoDB's configurable read/write concerns, Cosmos DB's tunable consistency levels (strong, bounded staleness, session, consistent prefix, eventual), and Spanner's external consistency through TrueTime APIs. Understanding CAP enables informed architectural decisions based on business requirements for data consistency versus system availability.",
  
  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] OAuth 2.0 secure implementation requires careful attention to attack vectors and cryptographic best practices. Utilize the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to mitigate authorization code interception attacks. Implement state parameters with cryptographically secure random values (minimum 128-bit entropy) to prevent CSRF attacks. Token handling must employ secure storage mechanisms: httpOnly, secure cookies for refresh tokens, and memory-only storage for access tokens in browser environments. Validate redirect URIs against exact matches, never wildcards. Implement proper token lifecycle management with short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes), longer-lived refresh tokens with rotation policies. Apply the principle of least privilege through granular scopes. For client authentication, utilize client_secret_jwt or private_key_jwt methods rather than client_secret_basic. Implement proper error handling without information disclosure, rate limiting on token endpoints, and comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring.",
  
  "query_5": "[Role: Domain Expert] The React versus Vue architectural decision requires analysis of technical constraints, team capabilities, and long-term maintenance considerations.
