  "query_2": "[Role: Research Librarian] Recent developments in OpenAI's GPT models include continued improvements to GPT-4 variants, with enhanced reasoning capabilities and reduced costs for API usage. OpenAI has been focusing on making their models more efficient and accessible, with ongoing work on multimodal capabilities. They've also been expanding availability of their models through various partnerships and API improvements. For the most current news and announcements, I'd recommend checking OpenAI's official blog, their Twitter account, and major tech news outlets, as developments in this space happen frequently and my information may not reflect the very latest updates.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Domain Expert] The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in any distributed system, you can guarantee at most two out of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (the system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (the system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means: CP systems (like traditional RDBMS) sacrifice availability during network partitions to maintain consistency; AP systems (like many NoSQL databases) sacrifice consistency to remain available; CA systems don't truly exist in distributed environments since partition tolerance is mandatory. Real-world implications include choosing MongoDB (CP) for financial systems requiring consistency, Cassandra (AP) for social media feeds prioritizing availability, and understanding that 'eventual consistency' is often the practical compromise in distributed architectures.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Domain Expert] To implement OAuth 2.0 securely, follow these key practices: Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients and web applications. Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks. Implement proper token storage - use secure, httpOnly cookies for web apps or secure storage mechanisms for mobile apps. Validate all tokens server-side, never trust client-side validation alone. Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with refresh tokens for longer sessions. Implement proper scope validation and principle of least privilege. Always use HTTPS for all OAuth endpoints and redirects. Validate redirect URIs against a whitelist. For client credentials, never expose client secrets in frontend code - use them only in backend services. Consider implementing token introspection for real-time token validation and proper logout mechanisms that invalidate both access and refresh tokens.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] For a startup frontend, I'd recommend React based on your specific context. React offers a larger ecosystem, more job market availability for hiring, and extensive community support - crucial for startups with limited resources. Its component-based architecture scales well as your team grows, and the learning curve, while steeper initially, pays dividends in flexibility. Vue is excellent and more beginner-friendly, but React's market dominance means easier talent acquisition and more third-party solutions. However, consider these factors: If your team is junior-heavy, Vue might be faster to prototype with. If you're building something highly interactive, React's ecosystem (Redux, Next.js) provides more robust solutions. For rapid MVP development with a small team, Vue's simplicity wins. My recommendation: Choose React if you plan to scale the team quickly and need enterprise-grade solutions; choose Vue if you prioritize development speed and have a smaller, stable team.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Structure your salary negotiation strategically: First, research thoroughly using Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and industry reports to establish market rates for your specific role, location, and experience level. Document your achievements with concrete metrics - increased performance by X%, led projects worth $Y, reduced bugs by Z%. Time it right - ideally during performance reviews, after successful project completion, or when taking on new responsibilities. Present a comprehensive package: don't focus only on base salary, consider equity, bonuses, professional development budget, flexible work arrangements, and additional PTO. Structure the conversation professionally: schedule a dedicated meeting, present your research and achievements, make a specific ask based on data, and be prepared to negotiate. Have a walkaway number in mind but be collaborative. If they can't meet your salary request, negotiate other benefits. Remember, as a senior engineer, you have significant leverage - emphasize your impact on team productivity, mentoring contributions, and technical leadership value.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Learning machine learning as a complete beginner is an exciting journey, and I'd love to help you think through the best approach for your situation. Let's start by exploring what draws you to ML - are you interested in solving specific problems, advancing your career, or pure curiosity? This will help shape your learning path. What's your current background with programming and mathematics? If you're comfortable with Python and basic statistics, we can focus on practical applications. If not, we might want to build those foundations first. Consider this progression: Start with understanding what problems ML solves (recommendation systems, image recognition, predictions), then learn the fundamental concepts (supervised vs unsupervised learning, training vs testing), practice with visual tools like Teachable Machine, then move to code-based learning with beginner-friendly platforms like Coursera's ML course or fast.ai. What type of learner are you - do you prefer hands-on projects, structured courses, or theoretical understanding first? This will help us customize your approach.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Let's tackle your Node.js performance issue systematically. Start with profiling to identify bottlenecks - use Node.js built-in profiler with `node --prof` or tools like clinic.js for comprehensive analysis. Common performance killers include: blocking I/O operations (use async/await consistently), inefficient database queries (add indexing, use connection pooling), memory leaks (profile with heapdump), and CPU-intensive operations on the main thread (consider worker threads). Check your middleware stack - unnecessary middleware adds overhead. Implement proper caching strategies (Redis for session data, CDN for static assets). Monitor key metrics: response time, memory usage, CPU utilization, and error rates. Use APM tools like New Relic or DataDog for production monitoring. For immediate relief: enable gzip compression, optimize database queries, implement request rate limiting, and ensure proper error handling doesn't crash the process. What specific symptoms are you seeing - high response times, memory usage, or CPU spikes? This will help narrow down the investigation approach.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Practical Advisor] To convince your CEO to adopt AI tools, frame the argument in business terms they care about: ROI, competitive advantage, and risk mitigation. Start with a pilot project that shows measurable impact - perhaps using AI for customer service (reduced response times), content generation (marketing efficiency), or data analysis (better decision-making). Present concrete examples from similar companies in your industry who've seen success. Quantify the benefits: 'AI can reduce customer service costs by 30% while improving response times from 24 hours to 2 hours.' Address their likely concerns about cost by showing total cost of ownership vs. productivity gains, and about job displacement by framing AI as augmenting human capabilities, not replacing people. Propose a phased approach: start small, measure results, scale gradually. Prepare for resistance by having implementation plans ready, including training strategies and change management. Present risks of inaction - competitors using AI will have cost and speed advantages. Make it personal to your CEO's priorities: if they care about innovation, emphasize competitive edge; if they're cost-focused, emphasize efficiency gains.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Blockchain is a fascinating technology that's worth understanding, but let's explore what specifically interests you about it. Are you curious about cryptocurrency, the underlying technology, or potential business applications? This will help focus our exploration. Let's start with the fundamental question: what problem does blockchain solve? At its core, it creates trust between parties without a central authority. Imagine you and I want to trade, but we don't trust each other or any bank - blockchain creates a permanent, tamper-proof record that we both can verify. Think of it as a digital ledger that's copied across many computers, where everyone can see transactions but no single party controls it. What aspects intrigue you most - the technical mechanics (how the cryptography works), the economic implications (like Bitcoin), or practical applications (supply chain tracking, smart contracts)? Consider these questions: Why might decentralization be valuable? What are the trade-offs between security, speed, and decentralization? How do you think blockchain might impact industries you're familiar with? Let's explore your specific interests to build a deeper understanding.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Team productivity issues often stem from unclear priorities, poor communication, or systemic problems rather than individual performance. Let's diagnose and address this systematically. First, assess the root causes: Are goals and priorities clear to everyone? Is there too much context switching between projects? Are meetings consuming too much time? Is the team blocked by dependencies or unclear requirements? Start with these immediate actions: Implement daily standups to identify blockers quickly, use a visual project management tool (Jira, Trello) to track progress and priorities, establish 'focus time' blocks where interruptions are minimized, and create clear definition-of-done criteria for tasks. Address common productivity killers: reduce unnecessary meetings (could this be an email?), batch similar tasks, eliminate context switching, and ensure the team has the tools and authority they need. Measure what matters: track cycle time from task start to completion, identify recurring blockers, and get team feedback through regular retrospectives. Remember, productivity isn't about working more hours - it's about removing obstacles so your team can do their best work efficiently.",

  "query_12": "[Role: Socratic Guide] Python is a wonderfully versatile language, and I'm curious about what's driving your interest in learning about it. Are you looking to start programming for the first time, transition from another language, or explore specific applications like web development, data science, or automation? Understanding your goals will help us explore the aspects of Python most relevant to you. Let's think about what makes Python special: its philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity - 'there should be one obvious way to do it.' This makes it excellent for beginners but powerful enough for experts. What type of problems are you hoping to solve? Python excels in different domains: web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (pandas, numpy), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), automation (scripting, web scraping), and more. Consider these questions: What's your current experience with programming? What draws you to Python specifically? Are you more interested in understanding the language fundamentals, exploring its ecosystem, or seeing practical applications? Let's tailor our exploration to match your learning style and objectives."
