  "query_1": "[Role: Research Librarian] Based on my research of current pricing information, GitHub Copilot in 2025 typically costs $10/month for individual users and $19/month per user for business accounts. However, pricing can change, so I'd recommend checking GitHub's official pricing page for the most current rates. There are also free tiers available for students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open source projects.",
  
  "query_2": "[Role: Tech Industry Analyst] As of early 2025, OpenAI continues to evolve their GPT model lineup. Recent developments include improvements to GPT-4's reasoning capabilities and efficiency optimizations. However, for the most current announcements, I'd suggest checking OpenAI's official blog and recent tech news sources, as the AI landscape moves rapidly with new model releases and capability updates happening frequently.",
  
  "query_3": "[Role: Distributed Systems Expert] The CAP theorem states that in distributed systems, you can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (system continues despite network failures). Practically, this means you must choose trade-offs: CP systems (like traditional RDBMS) sacrifice availability during network partitions, while AP systems (like many NoSQL databases) accept eventual consistency. Understanding CAP helps architects make informed decisions about database selection and system design based on business requirements.",
  
  "query_4": "[Role: Security Engineering Specialist] Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires several key practices: Use the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for public clients, always validate state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks, implement proper token storage (secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage), use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens, validate all tokens server-side, and ensure HTTPS throughout. Additionally, implement proper scope validation, use well-tested OAuth libraries rather than rolling your own, and consider implementing rate limiting on your authorization endpoints.",
  
  "query_5": "[Role: Startup Technology Advisor] For a startup frontend choice, both React and Vue are solid options, but I'd lean toward React for most startups. React has a larger talent pool (easier hiring), more extensive ecosystem, better job market for your team's future mobility, and stronger corporate backing. Vue offers gentler learning curves and potentially faster initial development, but React's market position provides better long-term sustainability. Consider your team's current skills, timeline constraints, and whether you need mobile development (React Native gives React an edge). The technical differences are less important than ecosystem and talent considerations for most startups.",
  
  "query_6": "[Role: Senior Engineering Career Coach] For salary negotiations as a senior engineer: First, research market rates using levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and network contacts. Document your achievements with specific metrics and business impact. Present a compelling case showing your value delivery, not just tenure. Consider the full compensation package including equity, benefits, and growth opportunities. Time negotiations strategically (performance reviews, after major wins, or during offer periods). Be prepared to walk away if the offer doesn't meet your researched market value. Practice your pitch beforehand and remain professional throughout. Remember, negotiation is expected at senior levels and shows business acumen.",
  
  "query_7": "[Role: Learning Path Mentor] As a complete beginner in machine learning, I recommend this structured approach: Start with foundational math (linear algebra, statistics basics) using Khan Academy. Learn Python programming fundamentals first if you haven't already. Then begin with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera for conceptual understanding. Practice with hands-on projects using scikit-learn for classical ML, then progress to deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch. Focus on understanding problems ML solves rather than just algorithms initially. Build a portfolio with real projects, join ML communities, and practice consistently. The journey takes months, not weeks, so pace yourself sustainably.",
  
  "query_8": "[Role: Performance Engineering Consultant] To help debug your Node.js performance issue effectively, I need more specifics about the symptoms you're experiencing. Generally, start by profiling with Node.js built-in profiler or tools like clinic.js. Check for common culprits: blocking synchronous operations, memory leaks, inefficient database queries, or CPU-intensive tasks blocking the event loop. Monitor key metrics: response times, memory usage, CPU utilization, and event loop lag. Use APM tools like New Relic or DataDog for production insights. Can you share more details about the specific performance problems you're seeing?",
  
  "query_9": "[Role: Technology Strategy Consultant] To convince your CEO about AI tools adoption, focus on business outcomes rather than technology features. Prepare a compelling business case showing ROI through productivity gains, cost savings, or revenue opportunities. Use concrete examples from similar companies in your industry. Start with pilot projects demonstrating measurable value before requesting broader investment. Address concerns about cost, security, and job displacement proactively with factual responses. Present a phased implementation plan with clear success metrics. Emphasize competitive advantages and risks of falling behind competitors who are already adopting AI. Make it about strategic necessity, not just technological novelty.",
  
  "query_10": "[Role: Blockchain Technology Educator] Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized record-keeping without intermediaries. Key concepts include immutable transaction records, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic security. Practical applications span beyond cryptocurrency: supply chain tracking, smart contracts, digital identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi). However, blockchain isn't a universal solution - it adds complexity and energy costs. Consider blockchain when you need decentralization, transparency, and trust without central authority. For most business applications, traditional databases remain more efficient. Focus on understanding the problems blockchain solves rather than the technology itself.",
  
  "query_11": "[Role: Team Leadership Coach] Team productivity issues often stem from unclear goals, poor communication, or process bottlenecks rather than individual performance. Start by identifying specific productivity challenges through team feedback and metrics analysis. Common solutions include: establishing clear priorities and expectations, implementing effective meeting practices, removing blockers and administrative overhead, improving tools and workflows, and fostering psychological safety for open communication. Consider whether the issue is motivation, capability, or systemic. Regular one-on-ones can reveal individual concerns while team retrospectives address collective issues. Focus on empowering your team rather than micromanaging, and measure outcomes, not just activity.",
  
  "query_12": "[Role: Programming Language Guide] Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly programming language known for its readable syntax and extensive ecosystem. It excels in data science, web development (Django/Flask), automation, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Python's strengths include rapid development, large community support, extensive libraries (NumPy, pandas, requests), and cross-platform compatibility. It's interpreted rather than compiled, making it slower for compute-intensive tasks but excellent for prototyping and development speed. Popular in academia and industry alike, Python offers excellent career opportunities. Whether you're interested in web development, data analysis, or automation, Python provides a solid foundation with gentle learning curves."
