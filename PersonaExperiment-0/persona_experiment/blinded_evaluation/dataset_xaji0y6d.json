  "query_3": "The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer, states that in any distributed data system, you can guarantee at most two of three properties: Consistency (all nodes see the same data simultaneously), Availability (the system remains operational), and Partition tolerance (the system continues despite network failures). In practice, network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, so you typically choose between Consistency and Availability. CP systems (like traditional RDBMS in distributed mode) prioritize consistency but may become unavailable during partitions. AP systems (like Cassandra, DynamoDB) remain available but may serve inconsistent data. Modern systems often implement 'eventual consistency' to balance these trade-offs. The theorem helps architects make informed decisions about data consistency models, replication strategies, and system behavior during failures. Understanding CAP is crucial for designing reliable distributed applications and choosing appropriate databases for different use cases.",

  "query_4": "Implementing OAuth 2.0 securely requires careful attention to several key practices: Use HTTPS everywhere to prevent token interception. Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients to prevent authorization code interception attacks. Store tokens securely - use secure, httpOnly cookies or encrypted storage, never localStorage for sensitive tokens. Validate all tokens on the server side and implement proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms. Use the principle of least privilege for scopes - only request necessary permissions. Implement proper CSRF protection with state parameters. Validate redirect URIs strictly to prevent open redirect attacks. Consider implementing token binding for additional security. Regularly rotate client secrets and implement proper logging and monitoring. Use established OAuth libraries rather than building from scratch, and keep them updated. For highly sensitive applications, consider implementing additional security measures like mutual TLS or JWT with proper signature validation.",

  "query_5": "Both React and Vue are excellent choices for startup frontends, each with distinct advantages. React offers a larger ecosystem, extensive job market, and strong community support, making it easier to find developers and resources. It's backed by Meta and has excellent tooling. However, it has a steeper learning curve and requires more decisions about state management and routing. Vue provides a gentler learning curve, excellent documentation, and built-in solutions for common needs like routing and state management. It offers great developer experience with single-file components and is easier for teams transitioning from traditional web development. For startups, consider these factors: team expertise (React if you have React developers, Vue if you're building from scratch), project timeline (Vue might be faster to start), scalability needs (both scale well), and ecosystem requirements (React has more third-party solutions). Both have strong TypeScript support and mobile development options (React Native vs. NativeScript/Ionic). The choice often comes down to team preferences and specific project requirements rather than technical superiority.",

  "query_6": "Structuring salary negotiations as a senior engineer requires preparation, timing, and strategy. Research market rates using sites like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and industry salary surveys to establish your baseline. Document your achievements, including projects delivered, technical leadership, mentoring impact, and business value created. Time your negotiation strategically - performance reviews, project completions, or when taking on new responsibilities. Present your case professionally: highlight your contributions, demonstrate growth, and show market research. Consider the total compensation package, not just base salary - equity, bonuses, benefits, professional development budget, and flexibility all have value. Be prepared to negotiate multiple components if base salary has constraints. Practice your pitch beforehand and anticipate counterarguments. If the initial response is negative, ask what specific goals or achievements would warrant a review in 3-6 months. Consider external offers as leverage, but use them carefully and honestly. Remember that negotiation is a business conversation - stay professional, focus on value delivered, and maintain positive relationships regardless of outcome.",

  "query_7": "Starting machine learning as a complete beginner can feel overwhelming, but a structured approach makes it manageable. Begin with understanding the fundamentals: learn basic statistics, probability, and linear algebra - Khan Academy and 3Blue1Brown offer excellent visual explanations. Choose Python as your programming language and get comfortable with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Start with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera for solid theoretical foundations. For practical experience, use platforms like Kaggle Learn for hands-on tutorials and Jupyter notebooks for experimentation. Begin with supervised learning problems like classification and regression before moving to unsupervised learning and deep learning. Work on simple projects: predicting house prices, classifying images, or analyzing text sentiment. Use pre-built datasets from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing formulas - learn when to use different algorithms and how to evaluate model performance. Join communities like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or local meetups for support and networking. The key is consistent practice and gradually building complexity in your projects.",

  "query_8": "Debugging Node.js performance issues requires a systematic approach to identify bottlenecks. Start by establishing baseline metrics using tools like clinic.js or built-in profilers (node --prof). Common performance issues include: blocking I/O operations (use async/await properly), memory leaks (monitor with process.memoryUsage()), inefficient database queries (use query profiling and indexing), and CPU-intensive operations blocking the event loop (consider worker threads or clustering). Use profiling tools like Chrome DevTools (node --inspect), clinic.js suite for comprehensive analysis, or APM solutions like New Relic or DataDog for production monitoring. Check for common anti-patterns: synchronous file operations, unoptimized loops, excessive middleware, or improper caching strategies. Monitor key metrics: response times, memory usage, CPU utilization, and database query performance. Consider implementing proper logging and monitoring from the start. For immediate improvements, optimize database queries, implement caching (Redis/Memcached), use compression middleware, and ensure proper error handling doesn't impact performance. Load testing with tools like Artillery or k6 can help identify breaking points before production deployment.",

  "query_9": "Convincing a CEO to adopt AI tools requires a business-focused approach that addresses their primary concerns: ROI, competitive advantage, and risk mitigation. Start by identifying specific business problems AI could solve - customer service efficiency, data analysis speed, content creation costs, or operational optimization. Prepare concrete examples with quantified benefits: 'AI-powered customer support could reduce response times by 60% and handle 80% of routine inquiries automatically.' Research your industry's AI adoption trends and highlight competitive risks of falling behind. Address common CEO concerns directly: present phased implementation plans to minimize risk, discuss data security and compliance measures, and provide realistic timelines with measurable milestones. Propose starting with low-risk, high-visibility pilot projects that demonstrate clear value quickly. Present total cost of ownership including training, integration, and ongoing costs alongside projected savings and revenue increases. Use external validation - case studies from similar companies, analyst reports, or consultant recommendations. Offer to bring in AI vendors for demonstrations or proof-of-concepts. Emphasize strategic positioning: how AI adoption supports long-term business goals and market positioning. Finally, be prepared to address concerns about employee impact and change management with clear communication strategies.",

  "query_10": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked and secured using cryptography. Key concepts include: decentralization (no single authority controls the network), immutability (records cannot be easily altered), and consensus mechanisms (networks agree on valid transactions). Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain has applications in supply chain tracking, digital identity verification, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Benefits include transparency, reduced intermediaries, and tamper resistance. However, limitations include energy consumption (especially proof-of-work systems), scalability challenges, regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity. Different blockchain types exist: public (Bitcoin, Ethereum), private (enterprise solutions), and consortium (semi-decentralized). Understanding key terms helps: nodes (network participants), mining/validation (transaction processing), wallets (key storage), and gas fees (transaction costs). For businesses, consider blockchain when you need: transparent audit trails, multi-party transactions without trusted intermediaries, or immutable record keeping. However, traditional databases may be more appropriate for most use cases. The technology is still evolving, with developments in scalability (Layer 2 solutions), sustainability (proof-of-stake), and interoperability between different blockchain networks.",

  "query_11": "Team productivity challenges often stem from communication gaps, unclear priorities, or process inefficiencies. Start by identifying specific productivity issues through team feedback, metrics analysis, and observation. Common problems include: unclear goals and priorities, excessive meetings, context switching, inadequate tools, or team dynamics issues. Implement structured approaches: establish clear OKRs or sprint goals, conduct regular retrospectives to identify blockers, and create communication protocols that minimize interruptions. Consider productivity frameworks like Getting Things Done, time-blocking, or the Pomodone Technique for individuals, and Agile methodologies for team coordination. Address tool and process issues: evaluate your current toolstack for efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure knowledge sharing systems are in place. Foster team engagement through regular one-on-ones, team building activities, and professional development opportunities. Measure productivity meaningfully - focus on output quality and business impact rather than just hours worked or tasks completed. Create an environment that supports deep work: minimize unnecessary meetings, establish 'focus time' blocks, and reduce context switching. Address individual performance issues directly through coaching and support. Sometimes productivity issues reflect broader organizational problems like unclear strategy, resource constraints, or cultural misalignment that may require escalation or systemic changes.",
