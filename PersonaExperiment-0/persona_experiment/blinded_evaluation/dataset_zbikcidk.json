  "query_1": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your step-by-step action plan for GitHub Copilot costs: 1) Visit github.com/features/copilot/plans to get current 2025 pricing (typically $10/month individual, $19/month business). 2) Start with the 30-day free trial to test value before committing. 3) Track your productivity gains during the trial - measure time saved on code completion and bug fixes. 4) If you're at a company, propose a team pilot with 3-5 developers for 2 months. 5) Calculate ROI: if Copilot saves even 30 minutes per day per developer, it pays for itself. 6) For students, check if you qualify for free access through GitHub Education.",

  "query_2": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's how to stay current on OpenAI developments: 1) Set up Google Alerts for 'OpenAI GPT' and 'OpenAI API updates'. 2) Follow @OpenAI on Twitter and subscribe to their blog at openai.com/blog. 3) Join the OpenAI Discord community for real-time discussions. 4) Check the OpenAI API changelog monthly for feature updates. 5) Subscribe to AI newsletters like The Batch (deeplearning.ai) or AI Breakfast for curated updates. 6) Set aside 15 minutes weekly to review these sources. 7) For immediate needs, search 'OpenAI news 2025' to find recent announcements. This systematic approach ensures you won't miss important developments that could impact your projects.",

  "query_3": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's how to apply CAP theorem practically: 1) Understand the trade-off: you can only guarantee 2 of 3 - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance. 2) For your system design decisions: Choose CP (like traditional RDBMS) when data accuracy is critical (banking, inventory). Choose AP (like Cassandra, DynamoDB) when uptime matters more than perfect consistency (social media, content delivery). 3) Practical steps: Map your use cases to these patterns, design for the 99% case not edge cases, implement monitoring for the dimension you're sacrificing. 4) Remember: partition tolerance is usually non-negotiable in distributed systems, so you're really choosing between consistency and availability. 5) Start with a CP system and only move to AP if availability requirements demand it.",

  "query_4": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your secure OAuth 2.0 implementation roadmap: 1) Use a proven library (don't roll your own) - Passport.js for Node, Spring Security for Java, Authlib for Python. 2) Follow these security steps: Always use HTTPS, implement PKCE for public clients, use short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes), store refresh tokens securely with httpOnly cookies. 3) Essential validations: Verify state parameter to prevent CSRF, validate redirect URIs against a whitelist, check token audience and issuer. 4) Implementation order: Set up authorization endpoint first, then token exchange, finally resource access. 5) Test with tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerabilities. 6) Log all authentication events for monitoring. 7) Have a token revocation strategy ready. Start with the authorization code flow - it's the most secure for web applications.",

  "query_5": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your React vs Vue decision framework: 1) Choose React if: You have React developers available, need extensive third-party ecosystem, plan to use React Native later, or have complex state management needs. 2) Choose Vue if: Your team is new to frameworks, you want faster development speed, you prefer component-based architecture with less boilerplate, or you're building a smaller to medium app. 3) Practical steps: Build a simple todo app in both frameworks over 2 days, evaluate which your team grasps faster, consider your hiring pool (more React developers available), check which has better documentation for your use case. 4) For startups, I typically recommend Vue for faster MVP development, but React if you plan to scale the team quickly. 5) Make the decision in one week max - analysis paralysis costs more than picking the 'wrong' framework.",

  "query_6": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your salary negotiation action plan: 1) Research first: Use levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and Blind to get market data for your role, location, and experience level. 2) Document your value: List 3-5 concrete achievements from the past year with quantifiable impact (reduced deployment time by 40%, led team of 5, etc.). 3) Timing strategy: Initiate during performance reviews, after successful project completion, or when you receive competing offers. 4) The conversation structure: Start with appreciation, present market research, highlight your contributions, make a specific ask (not a range), then pause for their response. 5) Beyond salary: Negotiate equity, vacation time, professional development budget, or flexible work arrangements if salary is fixed. 6) Get everything in writing before accepting. 7) Practice the conversation with a trusted friend first. Remember: they already invested in you - negotiating shows confidence, not greed.",

  "query_7": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your beginner ML learning roadmap: 1) Week 1-2: Complete Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera (free) for fundamentals. 2) Week 3-4: Learn Python basics if needed using Python.org tutorial or Codecademy. 3) Month 2: Hands-on practice with Kaggle Learn's micro-courses (free) covering pandas, scikit-learn basics. 4) Month 3: Pick one domain that interests you (computer vision, NLP, or tabular data) and complete 2-3 Kaggle competitions in that area. 5) Tools to install: Python, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. 6) Study schedule: 5-7 hours per week consistently beats cramming. 7) Join ML Twitter and r/MachineLearning for community. 8) Build a portfolio of 3 projects on GitHub. Focus on understanding the problem-solving process, not just the algorithms. Start today with the Coursera course.",

  "query_8": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your Node.js performance debugging action plan: 1) Install monitoring tools immediately: Use Node.js built-in profiler with --prof flag, add application performance monitoring like New Relic or DataDog. 2) Identify bottlenecks systematically: Check memory usage with process.memoryUsage(), profile CPU with Chrome DevTools, analyze event loop delays with @nodejs/clinic. 3) Common fixes to check first: Optimize database queries (add indexes, use connection pooling), implement caching (Redis for session data), compress responses with gzip, optimize middleware order. 4) Measure everything: Set performance budgets, use load testing tools like Artillery or k6. 5) Quick wins: Enable keep-alive connections, use async/await properly (avoid blocking the event loop), optimize JSON parsing. 6) If you share your specific symptoms and code snippets, I can provide targeted solutions. Start with profiling - you can't optimize what you can't measure.",

  "query_9": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your AI adoption proposal strategy: 1) Start with concrete use cases: Identify 2-3 specific problems AI could solve in your organization (customer service automation, code review assistance, data analysis). 2) Calculate potential ROI: Estimate hours saved per week, multiply by average salary, compare to AI tool costs. Present this as annual savings. 3) Propose a 3-month pilot program: Choose one high-impact, low-risk use case, define success metrics, involve key stakeholders as participants. 4) Address CEO concerns proactively: Data security (choose tools with enterprise security), job displacement (frame as augmentation, not replacement), cost justification (start small and scale). 5) Presentation structure: Problem statement, proposed solution, pilot plan, success metrics, investment required, next steps. 6) Get buy-in from department heads first - CEO will be more receptive with internal support. 7) Schedule a 30-minute meeting, not a long presentation. Focus on business impact, not technical details.",

  "query_10": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's what you need to know about blockchain for practical decisions: 1) Core concept: Decentralized ledger that's tamper-resistant but slow and energy-intensive. 2) Real-world applications that work: Supply chain tracking (Walmart uses it for food safety), digital identity verification, smart contracts for simple agreements. 3) When NOT to use blockchain: When you need fast transactions, when a regular database works fine, when you have a trusted central authority. 4) Key considerations: Transaction costs, scalability limitations, regulatory compliance, environmental impact. 5) If evaluating for business: Ask 'Do we need decentralization?' and 'Can we tolerate slow, expensive transactions?' 6) For learning: Understand Bitcoin and Ethereum basics, try creating a simple smart contract on a testnet. 7) Bottom line: Blockchain solves specific trust and decentralization problems but isn't a magic solution. Focus on the business problem first, then consider if blockchain adds value.",

  "query_11": "[Role: Practical Advisor] Here's your team productivity improvement plan: 1) Diagnose first: Survey your team anonymously about blockers, hold 1-on-1s to identify specific issues, track metrics like cycle time and bug rates. 2) Address common productivity killers: Too many meetings (implement no-meeting mornings), unclear requirements (create definition of done), context switching (batch similar tasks), waiting on approvals (streamline decision-making). 3) Quick wins this week: Remove one recurring meeting, set up async standup updates, create a 'blocked items' board everyone can see. 4) Medium-term improvements: Implement proper code review process, invest in better tooling, establish clear communication channels. 5) Measure progress: Track story points completed, deployment frequency, team satisfaction scores. 6) Weekly team retrospectives to continuously improve. 7) Focus on removing friction rather than adding processes. Remember: productivity issues are usually system problems, not people problems. Start with the biggest pain point your team identified.",
