# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Getting Started

When first working in this repository, read these key files to understand the project state and next steps:

1. **claude_code_implementation.md** - Technical implementation details and methodology
2. **isolated_persona_experiments.md** - Experimental framework and design
3. **evaluator_prompts.md** - Evaluation methodology and prompt templates
4. **current_state.md** - Current progress, status, and immediate next steps

After reading these files, ask relevant questions about what to do next based on the current experimental state and user goals.

## Project Structure

This is a persona experimentation framework for testing different AI response approaches:
- `persona_experiment/` - Initial experiment (Iteration 0-1)  
- `persona_experiment-02/` - Current scaled-down experiment (Iteration 2)
- Python analysis scripts for statistical evaluation
- Blinded evaluation datasets and response collections
