## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority - Complete Core Experiment

1. **Generate Missing Response Files (30 files)**
   ```
   For each condition, create 6 additional agent responses:
   - control_responses_agent_2.json through agent_7.json
   - test_1_hardcoded_responses_agent_2.json through agent_7.json
   - test_2_predefined_responses_agent_2.json through agent_7.json
   - test_3_dynamic_responses_agent_2.json through agent_7.json
   - test_4_dynamic_tone_responses_agent_2.json through agent_7.json
   ```

2. **Create Complete Evaluator System (13 evaluators)**
   ```
   Pairwise Evaluators (6 remaining):
   - Evaluator 2: Test 2 vs Control
   - Evaluator 3: Test 3 vs Control
   - Evaluator 4: Test 4 vs Control
   - Evaluator 5: Test 1 vs Test 2
   - Evaluator 6: Test 3 vs Test 4
   - Evaluator 7: Best performing vs second best
   
   Absolute Evaluators (7 total):
   - Evaluators 8-14: Independent scoring of all blinded datasets
   ```

3. **Execute Full Evaluation Process**
   - Run all pairwise comparisons with A/B randomization
   - Run all absolute evaluations
   - Ensure role indicators are stripped from all evaluations
   - Save all evaluation results in structured JSON format

### Medium Priority - Analysis & Validation

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculate inter-evaluator reliability (Cronbach's alpha)
   - Perform significance tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney U)
   - Calculate effect sizes (Cohen's d)
   - Generate confidence intervals for all metrics

5. **Cross-Validation**
   - Compare pairwise vs absolute evaluation results
   - Identify any systematic biases or anomalies
   - Validate consistency across different evaluators

6. **Query-Type Breakdown Analysis**
   - Analyze which personas work best for which query types
   - Create performance heatmap by query category
   - Identify optimal role assignment patterns

### Low Priority - Reporting & Documentation

7. **Generate Comprehensive Results**
   - Create detailed statistical report
   - Generate visualizations (box plots, heatmaps, win/loss charts)
   - Document any technical issues or limitations

8. **Executive Summary**
   - Clear findings on each test condition
   - Recommendations for production implementation
   - Next steps for iteration 03

## 🚨 Critical Issues

1. **Sample Size Too Small**: 1 agent per condition vs required 7 agents
2. **Evaluation Coverage**: Only 1/28 required evaluations completed
3. **No Statistical Power**: Cannot draw valid conclusions with n=1
4. **Missing Key Comparisons**: Haven't tested most persona approaches
5. **No Reliability Testing**: Cannot validate evaluator consistency

## 🎯 Current Action Plan

**CURRENTLY EXECUTING:** Systematic completion of experiment in phases

### Phase 1: Response Generation (IN PROGRESS)
- Creating 30 additional response files (6 agents per condition)
- Using Task tool with general-purpose subagent for batch generation
- Will generate varied, high-quality responses following condition constraints

### Phase 2: Evaluation System (NEXT)
- Create 13 additional evaluators (6 pairwise + 7 absolute)
- Implement proper bias controls and A/B randomization
- Strip role indicators for blind evaluation

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis (PLANNED)
- Inter-evaluator reliability testing
- Significance tests and effect sizes
- Cross-validation of pairwise vs absolute results

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Reporting (FINAL)
- Statistical summaries with visualizations
- Executive summary with clear recommendations

## 📊 Expected Timeline to Completion

- **Response Generation**: 3-4 hours (30 additional response files)
- **Evaluation System**: 2-3 hours (13 additional evaluators)
- **Statistical Analysis**: 1-2 hours (proper analysis with significance tests)
- **Final Report**: 1 hour (comprehensive summary with visualizations)

**Total Estimated Time to Complete**: 7-10 hours

## 💡 Key Learnings So Far

From the limited evaluation completed:
- Hardcoded roles show strong positive impact (+0.5 point improvement)
- Structured responses with concrete examples drive quality gains
- Role specialization (Research/Domain/Practical) is effective
- Need full evaluation to validate these preliminary findings

**Status: Experiment requires significant additional work to reach valid conclusions.**
